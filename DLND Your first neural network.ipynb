The idea is that for each training pass, you grab a random sample of the data instead of using the whole data set.

However, it can become too specific to the training set and will fail to generalize to the test set. This is called overfitting. You'll need to choose enough epochs to train the network well but not too many or you'll be overfitting.\n",

If the network has problems fitting the data, try reducing the learning rate. Note that the lower the learning rate, the smaller the steps are in the weight updates and the longer it takes for the neural network to converge.\n",

If the number of hidden units is too low, then the model won't have enough space to learn and if it is too high there are too many options for the direction that the learning can take. The trick here is to find the right balance in number of hidden units you choose."
