That's because it's such a nice one.
There.
What crap?
What good stuff?
Queen Harry?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
But she doesn't want to date.
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Who?
What's this?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
I thought you were above all that
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what did I have an effect on ?
The duck?
No, I won't go with you
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I know.
No, Daddy.
Parts of it.
Bianca did what?
Tempestuous?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
What plan?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Tumescent!
Absolutely not.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
They took everything...
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
Passion is something one cannot control!
What are you saying?
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
The land is there.  I know it!
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Are you married?
No.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
In the kitchen.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
No!  Nothing happened.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
What's he looking for?
Watch the news?
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
See you later.  Good luck.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Hi, I'm Honey.
Yes.
Don't speak Russian!
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Whore?
Sit down!
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
You got that?
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
A job?
As a plumber?!
We started over, you can too.
How did you start the fire this time?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
CONTINUED
Yes, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
How is gregor?
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah?
How about chargin' the battery?
I ain't tired yet.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You lying son of a bitch...
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Thank you.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
He's after your money.
Not likely, convict.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Thanks.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Doesn't look like it.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
How do you know?
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Rosalie, you okay?
How about some ammo?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
You are a monster, Zorg!
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
He's a she!
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
What is?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I don't have time... I need to know.
I was talking to the cat.
I don't need one.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When EVIL returns so shall we.
30 seconds...
Six to the left. One to the right.
He's on vacation.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
You know how to fly this thing?
What did you say? What did you do?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
I'm not going.
I thought you were divorced.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Love...
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I'm so very sad.
I told you not to read all that crap!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Uh..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Options.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Hello?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I don't know what to say
Who are you calling?
Anything harder?
What are you talking about?
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
That's five thousand dollars.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
What are these for?
What are you... ?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Is that him?
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
Celebrity Films.
Yeah.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Show me where you buried her.
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Remember me?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
I'm a working stiff, pops.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
How are you?  Having any luck?
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
Yes.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Will you let me look?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who is this... ?
No...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Rick...I can't.
You alright?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I can't go back to sleep again.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
Extra money, huh?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Enough of that crap.
So?
Nice neighborhood.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Hi, beautiful.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
But how are we gonna --
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Then get out!
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Well?
Seems to be all around...
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Something wrong?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
There's got to be an explanation!
What's the running time?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Well, I'll be - !
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Twombley involved?
No.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
You might not kill it.
Oh.
Safety on?
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
What blood?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
I'm not saying that.
Fuck you.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Yeah. A few things.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Lillian!
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Okay. She's fine.
You don't mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Oh, Wade.
Strange.
Of course! I would've heard.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
You're not using it today?
It makes me sad.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
It don't look right.
You talked to Jack?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Twombley.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
That it wasn't an accident.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
That's affirmative.
Who did this?
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
No.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
You know what?
What?
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Forget it.  I was reading.
Felt like a large asteroid.
If that's the way you want it.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Not now, Elaine.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
He's a boy dog.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
That's right.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted...
Yes?
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh, I'd love to.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
In there.
Lay off, asshole.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Yes.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
I'm going home.
Well, let's roll, George.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Uh, George...
... It's Harcourt.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
The human?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Yeah.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Ripley...
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Now, wait a second --
So.
Sir?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Save it.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
They're in the approach corridor.
It's game time.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Yeah.  What?
And how are we today?
Why not?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Don't go!  Please.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Mommy...Mommy?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
A Turkish brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
No, she's fine.
Hardly.
Now?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
No!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Oh, Stanzi.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
Originals?
What for?
How much will you pay him?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
Be careful!
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
I have no idea.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, sir.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Do you always live like this?
How many pupils do you have?
What's that?
No one calls you that.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
What medicine?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Love, Sire!
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Do you have a daughter?
How fortunate.
But what is it they don't like?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Yes?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Yes.
Do you have me?
That's wonderful!
And that's it. Do you have it?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Mozart -
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
About what?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Well?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
My son, no one can speak for God.
You mean that play?
Incredible.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes, Doctor?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Yes, I should think so.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
It wasn't a lunatic.
Call me Alex.
You're a very beautiful girl.
What do you dream about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
The zoo?
But...
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
Has he been refusing food?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
You're in a hospital in London.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
A coyote.
Heathcliffe.
Oh shit. What is that?
Yeah.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Yes.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
You were saying?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Where's Matt?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
What do you mean, help?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Fifty thousand dollars!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
What do you mean?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Well, you can. You always could.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Yes, sir.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
He was here?
What did you find out, Mike?
Dude Finlay?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
You can ride like that?
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
How?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Beg pardon?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
She was European!
So what do we do, General Lee?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I got us through the War all right.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I reckoned.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
What do you think?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Yeah, Jimmy?
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
How much of that story is true?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
You didn't want to farm?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Let me see that.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
I'm not hanged yet.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Good.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Stop it. I'm...
Courtney? Dinner?
J&B. Straight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Pull out.
Nothing like last time, promise.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He's rich.
He has a great body
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
I'm just leaving.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
When?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Jean? What?
Where are you?
What are I doing?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
She's my...cousin.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No, really. I'm okay.
Bad habit.
No. Not really.
Don't you know this?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Don.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I'm hungry.
Speak up. Come on.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
...But?
Teddy was killed last night.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
You look beautiful.
...wanna savor this.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Milo?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Okay.
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Did I say something?
Why's that?
Why would you do a thing like --
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Why were you so careless?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Bring it to the other location.
So how'd you like the house?
What're they building?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Hungry.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Yes Basil?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Here, use mine.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Of course, luv.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
You know who.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Indeed.
Yes.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
Kiss me.
That's not mine.
Don't mind if I do.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ow! You shot me!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why?
Did you ever want to?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Secret ...
... love ...
Would that I could say the Same.
Have we met?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Hmmm ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
What are you trying to do to me?
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
June, July ... August?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Is that written in his shoe?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Not for a moment.
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
How did you guess?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Amnesia?
Guilty until proven innocent?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
I was at Harrow ...
Rules are made to be broken.
What's happening?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I'm marrying Debbie.
I don't want any trouble.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
You better not have too much joy.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Why is Cole here?
Your whores never showed up.
What are you...
Let's go.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You want to share it?
What the hell are you doing?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
The phone made me do it!
Mrs.?
Under the table!
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
About what?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Reach out and snort someone.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I don't know.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Is he...
It doesn't go like that.
Who asked you?
Yeah? What about Laura --
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Ready?
Thanks for the insight.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
What are we going to do about this?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
When I was twenty.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
I don't know anything about it.
Yes.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
What's to believe?
Yeah.
Large?
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Let me think about it.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
All right. What are you gonna do?
How's the case going?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
I'm out.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
That ain't funny.
To what?
I won't do it anymore.
Four minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I'm feelin' dis'!
What are there character traits?
Exactly!
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
This has to be a big mistake.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
How long has my father been like this?
So what's up with you?
What is your problem?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
How did you get this gig?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Yes you!
I never had a really real pair before.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I thought you got rid of...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
You don't read, do you?
Maybe you need to start.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
And what?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Then you yield to me.
No.
Have you had one?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Who?
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
What about Pike?
Yeah, right...
I'm not telling you what happened.
That son of a bitch.
I apologize --
And he'd been shot.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
We don't need the tapes --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
What business?
Where's the cabin?
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Oh, come on --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
But you didn't.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Well?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What I said before --
That's horseshit and you know it.
You and the Colonel go back.
Move him.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
What is that?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
We're fucked, I know --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
We were close to something with Kendall.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
So you took off your shirt?
Fifty minutes.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
Sir, yes, sir!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Can I see him?
You must be Edward Bloom.
Please. Go. Just go.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Really.
Spooning the sherbet.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
You were talking about your wedding.
I like your stories.
Okay.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You owe me three-fifty.
You mean, while I'm here.
Son?
What?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
How what happens?
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You don't have to.
You never told me how your parents met.
Mmm.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
You first.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
The sets were good.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Hold on.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
You're asking for my documents?
Uh. Do you like England?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
He wants the money from your bank.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
In every sense. If at all possible.
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Why not?
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
What does it mean?
I need to uh...
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Hi.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Yeah.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
How long... how long I been out?
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
What do you want?
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
You take it straight?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
How you feelin' today?
I know that.
What'chu sayin'?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
This ain't gonna work.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I feel better. Do you?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
-- I should tear your head off.
What are you doing?
Let's go.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Joyce can be nice.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Why the hell not?
Yeah...
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Did I say that?
A resort city, Beppu.
Big enough.
No.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You all right?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
I need your help, Joyce.
And I'm supposed to care?
I don't remember saying yes.
We're in?
What if I chant?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
We're police officers.
You certainly have a nice place here.
If he won't cooperate?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
One man.  He must be good.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
But not to last.
Like what?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
No.  I got a problem.
Yeah?
What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
My job is here.
I don't know nothing about it.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
It's a good job.
Jeezus!
Are you apprehensive?
Why should I be?
Yeah.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Where is he?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Black?
Is this to be an empathy test?
No.
Well?
How do you know I'm not?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Don't move.
What desert?
What's your name?
Pris.
Where are your folks?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Yes?
How do you do?
Please excuse this interruption.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Oh, I could die...
I can't, it's yours.
Thank-Q!
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
It does?
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
Yes, ma'am!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Yes!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
The what?
No!  Not crazy!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Really?
Is that what you call it?
Really?  Okay!
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Are you all right?
Yes.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Uh-huh.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
And it's called...?
Who use to own it?
I don't think so.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Why?
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
How long will you set it for this time?
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
What's that supposed to mean?
I see "elegant."
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Always good advice.
Eve?!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Then what?
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Yes.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
Yes?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Is Sandy part of this?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Don?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Dorothy. No!
You called me Jeffrey.
Hold me, Don.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Where are we going, Frank?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Hello?
I don't want to go.
Heineken.
Hey? You like to walk.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
There ya go.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey? Why?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
What was that all about?
Where to?
Really?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What? What is it?
We... met them last night.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Is that right, Rambo?
Where the fuck are you going?
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
What?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
What the...?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Hello?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Worst day of my life, man.
Hello? You there?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Making Hutch David Soul?
This is he?
Would they do that?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Did you see that?
Holy shit.
Like he meant it.
What's wrong with him?
Well, then cut it in half.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
What about them?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
What the fuck is going on here?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
He needs to hire an attorney.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
When'd he tell you?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
I'm not. But there's --
Our money situation is not good.
I know that. But --
Shut up!
Shit, Dignan.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
Yeah. As a girl.
Roger.
Any activity?
I don't know.
Help me move him.
Wait for Kumar.
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
What's he in for?
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Could you grow cinnamon?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Let's not even talk about it.
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Bob.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
What are you doing?
Is he chasing us?
My brother's in jail.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
I couldn't hear anything.
The elevator broke.
Do you have your own room?
Do they let you --
I'm working on it.
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How you doing, Bob?
26 weeks.
Is he good?
Well, I left some money in there.
No. I just have short hair.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
You told me Bourne was dead.
And the Landy woman?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
And what are we looking for?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
...this is Conklin's computer.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Don't you want answers?
What?
Did he say anything to you?
Sit down.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Sir...
Who else knows about this?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Then what?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Conklin.
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
He was at the campground yesterday.
You drive.
Switch! You drive!
I love you, too.
Yes.
Say it.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No... Jason... please...
Don't need it. I remember everything.
You didn't answer my question.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
By who?
Are we hacking or asking?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
Does anyone know his politics?
What is it?!
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Wallace's followers.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Armed?
Test of manhood.
Good to see you again.
We must run in different directions!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
It matters not, he is thy king!
I do not confess.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
I'm not just saying it!
You scare me.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I am trying.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Darn it!
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Fix?
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
It was a long time ago.
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
What's happened to you?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
We'll find out soon enough.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Here you go, buddy.
My husband is with me, too.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Monsieur Rick, I --
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Do you know where they are?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Has it got a wow finish?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
When did you first find out he was alive?
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
Hello, Sam.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Yes?
Sam?
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
How do you do?
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Well, this might come in handy.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I slept very well.
Yes.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
What, again?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Victor Laszlo.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Manages what?
This is the end of the chase.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
No.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
No. Not me, boss.
Yeah, boss?
Save some for tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Why do they have to die for me?
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
I had it on the island with me.
I've got lots of time.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Chuck.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
You can't go now.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
What's that, written on the sail?
What will you do?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Which I didn't have.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
The place is falling apart.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I'm touched.
And never take.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Oh...
But you looked as if you liked it.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
It will be okay.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
"...did." Well, okay.
I'm okay--I can walk.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
But did you know him?
She looks after other people's children.
I don't remember.
Liberator...
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Where'd she get you?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
There was no visible wound?
I haven't read that.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
Do you know him?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
When will he be home, Major?
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Ten percent. Of how much?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
I was doing it for them.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Whoa. What?
Jake...
Shit.
She up for this?
Excuse me?
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Something stupid.
What about... The money?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
How do you deal with --
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Stop waving that thing around.
What do we need another Shill for?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Is it all fugasi?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
King ain't gonna like this.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
It's not history.
Did he buy it?
Who?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
I hate cheats.
The Indian rope-trick.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about five hundred.
Eight-fifty.
Three years, two months. March '93.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I've got a job.
It came my way. 450 a week.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Why did you take the money?
It's not that.
So how are you doing, dad?
To coincidence.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
The point is, they want a man inside.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And I thought you were only after my body.
How much do you owe?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Is it yes?
Hello...
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Of course I recognised him!
You did?
You've done pretty well.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
What are you, a cop?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
I make it six.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Energy shielding positive function.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
I have no proof that it was false data.
What?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Yeah?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
No wire.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
What're you talkin' about?
None of your business.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Can I say something in my defense?
You mean until you showed up?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
A grand.
Can you help me get her back?
You're a thief?
First time I ever heard that.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
How do I know you didn't?
You need to get out more.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Your basic hodge-podge.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You don't want to.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
A little what?
Gotta go.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
And why should she?
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Thanks, miss.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
We've got to take this slow...
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Ann Arbor?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Yeah.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
No... You don't think...?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Jam, listen up.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well? Continue! Continue!
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Simplicity, Hawk.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Good MORNING!
Yeah.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Beg pardon?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
I didn't say shit.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
How much longer is this gonna last?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Why is that?
What? How long was I asleep?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
No. Frank.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Where it came from?
Who's been giving you weird looks?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
He said to follow him.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
A sign from whom?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What else makes you feel regret?
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
Then how is time travel possible?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Thank you.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Come again?
He was a year ahead of us?
It is a big deal.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Dakota.
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Lester?
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
Here I am, Father.
Who to?
My dear President...  read it back...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
What other job you got?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
I can't do it...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
That's even a greater honor.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Was it -- swine?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Why -- why -- of course.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
I've always thought that myself.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
What is it?
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Oh yes?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Treves. Well done.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Yes, I think I can.
I could easily arrange...
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Good day...!
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Is he... dying then?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
y-y-yes--
Of course! You want out?
My name is...
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness...
Thank you very much.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Who are they of?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Yes. John wants it.
HE'S GONE!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's all right! It isn't happening!
What are what?
What's the matter?
Halfdan the Black.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
I'll tell you what...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Is there something the matter with it?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
What did he say?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
But you're the Gods!
You mean we'd be dead?
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
There is another way.
What do you think?
I AM one, Dad!
You will wait?
It can't do you any HARM...
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Who's that?
Can't make enough axe-heads!
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Shut up!
You've lost your mind.
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well I'M certainly not, either.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mother.
You weren't supposed to see that.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I remember.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
How are you today?
Why?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
You're sure? It's cold.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
I don't think we're ready.
Joely...
What if you hide me?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
This is our first "date" date.
What was I wearing?
I'm sure, I said.
Okay.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
You said...
You know what I did.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I think she's great.
I knew.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
It's true.
I might be making a mistake.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Hi.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I hope you get your work done.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I miss you.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
We haven't checked.
What?
Well, what should we do?
I don't know! I just said that!
No way. I can handle this.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
What do you want, Stan?
What's this?
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
This one's history. Moving on...
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
What was that?
You don't?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Going north?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Your ranch?
But Countess...
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I don't know anything about it.
Justin?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Pressure?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Thank you.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Justin, finish your sweep.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
I can see that, what're they for?
If it worked.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Then who the fuck are you?
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
What is it, Smith?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
I just finished drying...
Radiation interference?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
What is it, Starck?
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
You've got to listen...
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
No. I saw nothing.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
We have to do something, oh God...
What?
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Claire is your wife?
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
The forward airlock.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed?... Sue?
What do you mean "complete"?
What?
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Stay right. Left is trouble.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
But all these people...
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
What is that thing?
I'm driving.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
What are you doing here?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
On the ledge?
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Does Mom know you have company?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I don't know.
Are you really a virgin?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
It's definitely your mama.
I would. Yeah.
Hey, Rat.
Well, I've gotta be running.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Just be glad you're all right.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Don't you like him?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
That little prick.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yes.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Where do you feel like going?
It's very warm out tonight.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
What's April 16th?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naked!?
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
Las Vegas.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Shoot it.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
Jesus creeping shit!
Not much. Why?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
You degenerate pig!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Extract of pineal!
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
What?
Stop!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
We should go! We should go right now!
You know where it is?
Where is everyone?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
You got something better?
So, your husband ditched you?
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Oh.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
But --
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
He's dead.
Huh?
What do you mean what?
How many?
I'll go with ya.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Fine, Chief.
Move it!
Shit!
SHIT.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
OH JESUS!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Are you lying to me?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
You know what I mean.
Huh.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Who?
...Yes.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Thank you, Ralph.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Are you... are you hungry?
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Good.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You think I'd miss it?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Oh my God, I look awful.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
I should've known...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
What a man!
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm not sure.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Who're you?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
The speech? Real good.
Mama...
I don't care.
Mama, what's...
What?
How long will you be?
At one. Promise?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Where are you going?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
You what?
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
You're kidding.
Better that way... for me.
Friends? Do they live around here?
People can be kinder than you think.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
You dance so beautifully together.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I've loved you all my life
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.
What sort of task?
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
A warming wind.
No. But someday.
Quite a few.
Now you've got him started.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Quite a place.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Let's go back, Barry...
What hath God wrought?
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Umhummmmph.
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
How much do I owe you?
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah, follow us.
Why do you want to stop?
What about Kate?
Come again?
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Was? As in not anymore?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
What are you going to do?
Now, is your shit together?
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
That happens, you'll get it back.
No!
What?
What you said to me in the room.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
-- you got your sink --
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Hot goddamn day!
What the fuck is wrong with you --
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Do they have cable?
Do they have a waterbed?
How's it feel?
How do you know?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
What?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Really, I have no problem with --
I'm not sure what --
Think I overplayed it?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
O'Neil?
Sir?
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Just like you would be.
Me?  Why me?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
No shortage of suspects.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
At first.
O'Neil?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
She part of the training?
"Dad."
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
You okay?
What are you doing?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Most people don't.
I got pretty close.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
And you're beautiful...
What?
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
Merde!
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Sounds like a big company.
Why do you need that?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
God, what an ass.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You go first! There's no time!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
He's a twit!
Not again...
What's happened?
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
You said "the Commander.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Yes but, we were wondering-
There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
What?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Hey... Hey where are you going?
How does the rolling help, actually?
never doubted you for a second.
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Commander...
Well... Sort of...
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Wil...
Yes, general.
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Lafayette is a child!
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
The British army, sir!
Unofficially, General Greene.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I... they look both the same.
I only meant...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
What else?  From Virginia?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Let's get you darker!
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
You're kidding me, right?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear...
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You gave him the money?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I don't believe this.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
I can't do it.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
What?
I don't like waiting.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
I'm looking at you.
I know what a marker is.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
You mean, Leo?
But you work for the casino?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
Wait. How about this?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Sounds fair.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
And you think the movie business is any different?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
I'll be right back.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm going into the movie business.
I'm thinking about producing.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
'We?'
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Smokes?
Get up.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Went aboard.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
The radio!
What the hell happened!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Could be a fishing boat.
Candy?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Nope.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Murphy to Epps.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Not our mystery guest again.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
They went crazy.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Ho-ly shit.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Well, yes...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Hi Josh.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
I might actually get the pasta special.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
What is this?
I remember every minute of that party.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
What are you talking about -- who?
What does it stand for?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Like what?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
God, you're really obsessed...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
When was this?
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I dunno...
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
A what?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Who does?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
That tape sucked, by the way!
Fine, and how are you?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
A dollar seventy-five.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
It's not hopeless...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
That's the spirit!
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Boo!
Really?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What's up?
What?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
No... forget it...
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
I am.
Talk to us about it...
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Yes?
Let me see the sick.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Starling?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
You never had it.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Shhh.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
The workers don't get on?
Oh yes, I think so. 
I do, actually; very much.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Okay, that's no problem.
Hello, Peter.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
That's where the buggy stopped.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Who are you going to call?
What are you doing up here?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
What happened?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Does it have any favorites?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Tell him about the toaster.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
I want to help you.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Who's the stiff?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I want you inside me.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
Did you see it?  What was it?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Die in what sense?
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
What is it?
All right.  I'll try.
Set entry grid.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
And the seas would boil ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Those are priceless sculptures.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
I want that bastard dead!
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
They won't break this one.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
The Senate too?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
You cannot die.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I was summoned.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
He's very realistic.
What about their philosophy lessons?
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
You teach them!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Will you take me home now?
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
What?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
I want to ask you a question.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Is it because I'm here?
Because it isn't true.
Please let me go.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Yes.
Shhhh.
The day after tomorrow?
Hello -- who is this?
Exactly how do you mean?
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Did you get a room?
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is there an ashtray in here?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Pardon?
So?
I think I'll go to bed.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
But they would! Don't you see?
Get away from that door.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Yes, I do.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
That's fine.
To tell you?
What?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Anything. Anything at all.
Well?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Thank you.
About five years.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
See if you can guess.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Yes.
At college.
Do you understand that?
No.
Yes.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But if it's sickening for you --
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Drive down the block.
When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Oh, no.
Why did you say that?
-- worried?
Well --
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
That has nothing to do with it --
Say that again.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no.
Thank you very much, sir.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Now look -- please --
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
That's quite a statement.
Is anything wrong?
Well?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Like dancing?
Chasing what?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Yes -- oh!
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Why do you look at me like that?
So alone.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Why later?
Bless you...
Then you know him?
Yes, quite.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
What?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Ready, Kringelein?
I've no luck.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Oh, don't go.
What...! --
You...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
You're a little too fast.
Cotton Company --
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Well -- you want me?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
How clear is Manchester?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Madam should sleep.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Take them back, Suzette.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Four minutes past. Please come.
I know -- I know.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Hi, Bobo.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
My son --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Roy? He's always crying.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Here you are! Two rich people!
Yes, yes, but that's --
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
So I heard.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Just myself.
Sounds like a good Idea.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
No.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
A future. The only future I've got.
This time...
I can't. I just left home.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Are you sure?
Roy? It this all we have?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
That's just Lilly's way.
Every day in every way.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Upstate.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
I realize this is a shock.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Where are you going?
Nothing.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Why didn't you tell me?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Then I'll get caught.
It's John, isn't it?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
What?
Where's Shane?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Who are you?
Danny?!  Danny!
What now?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
I dunno, boy.
Home, sweet home.
You know what gets me?
I suppose.
The educational process.
Excuse me.
When?
I didn't know we had any women left.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Okay.  Okay.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
You're making a joke.
For what?
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Dr. Woodly.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Sir?
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
What's this?
Gee whiz, Dad--
Dad--
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
You don't even know me.
Bluh.
What's that all about?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
And no one's there now?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Unless she has nerve.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Now who's being cruel?
Hands and knees, you say?
My violin is avenged!
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
It's trash now, like mine.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Leave the rifle here.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
You don't know?
Alice got married again.
She did?
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I was afraid to ask.
Where will you be?
Don't know.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
He isn't?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Did you talk to Paul?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You're saying no.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
It is?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
What kind of a life is that?
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Why would you do that?
They didn't murder me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
You know each other?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Not true.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Yeah.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Are you Niki?
No.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Where is she?
Are you a private detective?
Tijuana.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Where does he live.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I've got a meeting...
I don't know.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Just leave me alone.
Is Marsha there?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Hey man.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's not true, Mr...?
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Okay.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
It's an investment.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Yearse!
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's very interesting.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why do you say that?
Over there by the courthouse.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Okay?
Yes.
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
But they have.
You sure have a way with people.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold. 
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
I don't care what people say.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
And why is that?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Does that worry you?
Yes.
Yes.
Jeez! That's a great story,
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
Souvenirs?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Julia.
You knew?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
Steve...
Story of my life.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
What was that??
Where do you --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Marco...
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Yes, I --
I don't remember.
Julia!
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Julia.
Good.
You're hurting.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
This is what began it.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You would be. They tore me apart.
And the blood let you out?
You can't love him.
So where's the harm?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Where's Daddy?
Not exactly modern.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
I'm going to throw up.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Please...
Drinking alone.
You want something to drink?
Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.
This isn't the bedroom.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
What's wrong?
Never better. You sleep well.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
He's gone.
Need any help?
You know I do know the way home.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I see.
Meaning what?
I beg your pardon?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Play it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
We'll do it next Monday.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
What?
Ehh.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Suck my ass.
You're not even coming?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
He's got one!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Don't do it, Rob!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
What are you talking about?
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Your desert island top-five.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Fine.  That's great.
Great.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
What's this?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
What is this.
You look upset.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Yeah.
I dunno.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Is it better?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I guess.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
It's me.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Sure they are.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Hello.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Yes, of course.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
What's the difference?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Very persuasive.
So?
What's happenin'.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
How're you holding up?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Enough, Liz.
Enough of what?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yes.  You?
I'm sure it isn't.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Which way are you going?
That way.  You?
Well call her mother.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
How old is Richard?
Happy birthday.
No.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Tradition.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
What about me?
No.
No.
No one knows you're here?
You had to do _nothing_!
I hope I never get that old.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Why?
Your name is Conor?
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Aye.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
I don't understand.
This is madness!
Aye.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
That is not me.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
What would you like?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Tradition.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Head still secure to the neck.
I haven't drunk this much since-
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Run!
What's the point?
A mystery.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
What's the idea of locking this?
Hello, Bensinger.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
No. Roy. Roy V.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No. My mother.
How's business, Bruce?
How long would the interview take?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, she'll know some day.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
I notice you still remember it.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
I haven't any hard feelings.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Sure you can. Come on.
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
No!
Get away, Svengali.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Where'd you meet this man?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Say, could I meet him?
Then what does he want with you?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
What now?
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Now you're talking!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
I'd like to think.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Is this the Community Hospital?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Sure, boss.
Walter!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
There's money in it, Cooley.
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I don't know --
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
So have we!
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
Now, Hildy --
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Here!
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
The City Sealer's office!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Is it hard?
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Who with?
Pauline.
...and four and five...
But Dad, It's the News.
You said that last year, Dad.
What is it?
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
What are you going to be then?
He always knows.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Is it peace in out time?
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
We did the decent thing.
What did I do to deserve this?
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Ma, Tiny's in.
What about the tree?
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
A dead one.
Hey, great they're back.
Wondering what?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
The Duke?
I don't drive cross country.
I don't.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Keep straight on this road here.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Tickets for what?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Why?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
So what?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
When?
Sleeping.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Tell me about it.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
You got to be fucking joking.
I still don't.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Recover any bodies?
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
Firefly.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I um... no, I don't think so...
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
When you were a little French girl?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
He's dead.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
That's what I'm counting on.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Lila, it's Rosie.
You've got to respect that.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes.
That's very funny.
Come on.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Yes.
Yahoo!
Ugnh.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Puff, put the gun down.
No, why?
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Boys just passing through?
I want to talk to you.
Do we need words?
Could be.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Okay?
Thought you only drank milk.
Character.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
For who?
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I never saw you do anything else.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Sign up.
Here, I got it.
Hey, Findley's here.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
It's a long walk.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
The expensive kind.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Hey!
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Mm hmm.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
You wanna drink?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
You need the words?
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
That is not now, human!
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You want to find them.
What do you want?
Have you looked inside?
Do you still want me to stay?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Need some gas?
Bathroom?
What's that, Dad?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
I'll take you to school.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
I swear it was here.
No.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
I have school.
What's his family background?
What do you want?
Are you all right?
You still got the Olds?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Spunky?
You punched the President in the face?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Thanks, Pops.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I had a feeling you would.
Any news on my wife?
Where's it headed?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
With their shields down it might be possible.
It's doing what?
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Your treat.
Dad?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
What?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Doctor Jones?
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Bingo.
Uh-huh.
Out!
Don't call me that, please.
Through the library?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
What final challenge?
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
You think so?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
Miss Scott panicked?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
Dr. Jones.
Step on it, Short Round!
No.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Come one, what's wrong?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
That's far enough!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
India...
What do you mean -- how?
What'd he say now?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
PET IT??!!
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Not leftovers?
Primitive sexual practices?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
And they don't even know what it really is.
I get it!
Who was it?
Yes.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Loading a gun.
Of course you do!
Why not?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
JOE Or what?
They could put you back in the tube..
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I don't like the sound of that.
We have to get out of here.
Who is it?
You mean...just leave.
I don't have any.
...and a license to kill...
Oh yeah, to what?
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Eating sushi?
What is it?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it.
Now what?
What was?
What is it?
.
Wait.
Touch her.
It worked.
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Not her. You!
You got any books in there?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
You been had. We have.
I can't...
I've got an idea.
Not sure at all.
haka xuki.
Left...The one with the red dot.
While he makes the run.
And Dieter?
Do something.
Keep thinking.
About what?
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What part what?
What is your name?
Rene?
Me.
How about a deal?
What Job?
Who is your friend?
I have a new client.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Enough ROmance.
I don't want to intrude.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
It may have been affected.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Al?
Just give me the keys.
Now you know what I know.
That you're not crazy.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why did you leave?
What did you tell them?
You work for Ryuji?
Who did?
What's he done?
We're very close.
How do you know you can trust me?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Why'd you ask him.
What?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Why not?
What a mess.
Don't worry.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Come on.
Excuse me?
Why are you on to him?
What about the others.
Wait.
Why?
Why not?
The other working.
Yeah? What for?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Sure. Where?
What do you mean, what's it do?
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Get me Wigand.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Okay. 
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Did you say Berman?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What are you and Mike going to do?
Yeah...
Is it too late?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
What do...
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
The new place? New.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Hello. You there
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that?
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Good. But Jeff...
You attract a crowd.
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I can't say that!
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form of the question!
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
You threatening my family, now, too?
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
What part?
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Is that... one person?
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
You have the pre-nup?
What?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Why do you think she did it?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Did you see the tape?
Why would you be here?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Marylin! Listen to me.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
No. Don't stop.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
We're damaged goods.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Friends?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Yes.
Hi.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
You were going to have this thug...?
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Miles.
Is this a lover?
You used his credit card.
He was right, wasn't he?
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Maybe.
What?
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Wait. I know you.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Video.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Yes, sir?
Mr. Warne?
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Where are you taking me?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, no.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Is that his name?
Oh, no—no.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
If you really mean it, I will.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
What do you think you're doing!
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Oh, yeah?
What happened?
I found it on the seat.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Like what?
Nope. No complaints.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Yeah?
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
You're crazy.
Well, take them off.
What's got into you?
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Hitch-hiking.
Amazing.
Here comes a car!
What're you going to do?
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Yes?
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I am, Joe.
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
Yeah.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What's on your mind?
Why—no—
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
What do you think, Lou?
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
You know you keep saying that.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
...Oswald?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
You still questioning any Cubans?
It leads farther than that.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Why?  What's wrong?
And Shaw?
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
No.
There were admirals.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
That's our case!
Dad, look what I drew.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Honey, you all right? 
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
My sympathies.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Six.
Do you walk home?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
I need a favor.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Why were you with him?
What's going on?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
You don't want much, do you?
Why does it need to be dark?
Shit.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
It was the other guy who busted me.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How do you feel about getting old?
It's different with men.
I walked right past you.
Does it happen to all men?
And Annette's it for you?
Why?
What're you, a bag lady?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
You don't actually do it that way?
He was here?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
That's my job.
Which one?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
In a dress.
How'd you find out?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Tell him you want to see him?
He's already there.
We're partners.
Where're you going?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
You know what we want.
Oh, so now you know him?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
And splittin' with her?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Thanks.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
I do okay.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Who?
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
How long?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
As low as two.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Guess where I am?
Uh-huh.
Who was Beaumont?
So we on the same page then?
Sure.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
Where's the rest of it?
Came outta where?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
We went to the parking lot.
That's right.
What'd you shoot her with?
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
How can I help you?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Comfortable?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Hear what?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Where is it?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Uh-huh.
He leave town?
Get me out of here.
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Then what are you doing here?
What isn't happening?
How do you know?
What do you want from me?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Now what?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had this weird flash just then.
Jake, you need to rest.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
No.  I see them.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
The room!
What happened to you?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And look what I got.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
I know.
I don't believe this.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I promise.
What's going on?
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
This isn't happening.
Goddamn you!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I no from around here.
Where's Wong?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Please come quietly.
He'll never make it.
Push 'em back.
Speaking.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
What do you mean?
The army?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
On top of him?
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
What are you doing?!!
What?
What?!
Okay that hurt.
Thorgan, suit up.
What the hell are you doing?
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
That's why I'm here.
You?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Well?
She needs a little time.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
Close the fucking door!
Jesus!
What do we do?!!
Barbie from hell...
The power's back up!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'm sending you the files.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
You got it.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Be careful.
You going to be all right?
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Got a pen on you?
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think she might've run out on you?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
Some friends and me took a house.
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Coming right to us!
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Charisma?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
I totally heard you did.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
You're being really immature.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
I still have your virginity!
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Mine too.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Yup.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Wow, dream big!
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Oh.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
We definitely want it to have junk.
Cold feet.
What are you?
No.
No?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
What...
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Please stop now.
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
What?!
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Aha! You love him.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
You're not listening to me.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Hly shht!
You sound shocked or something.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Juno, what's the matter?
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
We're actually, finally doing this?
That's me.
No it is not!
Happy birthday Adele.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Dahlia, no.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
...I do.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
How do you know that?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Not yet.
Early, just think...
His Parole Officer.
Umm. Altogether?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Well, how was it?
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
Probably.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
The cartoon?
Right.
Right.
Yep.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Darcy?
So really, it's good luck.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
She won't? Why not?
Tonight?
Do you like kissing me?
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
You know what I want to do?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Are you in trouble with the law?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I didn't bleed.
Do you know where he went?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yeah I get bored.
You think so?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What?
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
No, I need the original note.
You're a lying bastard!
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
What are you talking about?
Ready for round two?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Why not?
Not really.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
What makes you think I was there?
Hello.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
What word did you leave last night?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Very good.  How did you know?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
I just can't believe it.
He was watching you.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
You ready?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
We're not sure.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
That's it?
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
What are you looking for?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead after the game.
In a way.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
You have to win every point, don't you?
Relax.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
What do you want on it?
I tried again and got through.
Exactly.  It's the key.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
I'm not nervous.
Me too.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Lyssa ...
Yes.
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
I chose the wrong passage.
I can. Because I choose it.
Am I not worth returning to?
I ache with it.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
You will not, then?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
How did you know I had sons?
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
When did you last sleep, boy?
We must try to get horses.
Where are you going?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Would you desert your friends?
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
I was beautiful then.
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
You were scared, weren't you?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
What?
A little...
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...Don't you drink?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Are you two planning kids?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
What steps do we take now?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Why?
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Jumped where?
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
When are you leaving?
What, come on?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Where am I?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Where did he go?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No.
You're pretty drunk.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
You what?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Don't run away.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
Why?
No?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Can we just forget it?
How'd this happen?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I've been all right.
You have been lonely?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
So everything you just said --
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
What's going on?
Yes?
-- his life?
No!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Good one.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Our group is full.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Really?
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Here. You're gonna need this.
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
And you know this for a fact?
So?
The what?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
You really think I'm attractive?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
I did?
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
You got into Harvard Law?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Good. Good.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
You look -- nice.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Let's all go! Road trip!
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Then we smash 'em?
We come watch... we come watch...
Always.
What do you want with me?
To be my bride, of course.
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
No more... please...
What do you want from me?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
The colt's still too small.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Beware.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
What weapon?
Never show mercy!
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
I was with the Princess.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Never.
Liar!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
I detest serpents.
I'm not its master.
What happened?
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Lili!  No!
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Not very precise directions.
Dead, dead, dead.
And charmed, of course.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Be fair, Oona.
The fastest in the world.
Hello, Jack.
Sorry, Jack.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
Mom said I should.
Do you guys feel like painting?
Why?  What do you mean?
Are you his friend?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I don't know.
I don't know.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I was wondering.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
I have the permit.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
I hate this job.
Well, it's the least I can do.
She didn't really say.
You're here early today.
This has got to stop!
I'll ask.
Because I live there.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
The gloves on the table are for you.
Sit down for a second.
I know.  Why?
I know the feeling.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I gave up on you.
To hide a black eye.
I would have killed him.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
What would you do?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I aimed high.
Where have you been for a week?!
Why would they tow your truck?
Money?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
One of you would end up dead.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
It's not breakfast yet.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I need to know.
What did he say?
Been thinking?
He said he heard hammering.
I can't go right now.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Despite you.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Do it now!
I've missed you guys.
I guess I could teach you some things.
All day again?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
No, nigger.
Nigger.
A night in the hole?
Is Mae Rose okay?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
She got married last month.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Take care of me?
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
That's because I've never been here before.
I don't think so.
Where they taking us, anyway?
What are they gonna do to us?
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
A loan officer?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
He even got my daddy's watch.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
No, man. I want you to have it.
So?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I said you're soft.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
You drew this?!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Let it go, Claude.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I can't do it.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm all right.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
You got your own nightclub?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Move it out.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Me? Willie Long.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
ADRIAN!
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
My mom wasn't a goat?
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Where is he? He's late.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
You did it for Namath.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Bus?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Looking for the chief.
You gotta kill yourself.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
You think I'm a tourist?
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What was that?
Valerie?
Are you dead?
No.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Do me.
From? From? From?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Anybody we know?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I don't have much time.
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Of course --
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
But what is this -- why?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
How do we know this is the right way?
I doubt it.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
And Sanctuary?
What kind of jewel is this?
I don't know.
I'll make the arrangements.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
How long have you been living here?
I have always been here...
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Not yet.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Listen.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I can't see you tonight.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
He'll kill us.
Have you partied with him?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
How'd it happen, Alice?
So, should I call Andy?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Never saw him before in my life.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Something wrong?
What is it?
At your house.
What are you going to do?
A videotape.
From the club. You didn't answer.
What's that? Another tape?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Yeah.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You still care about me?
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What do you want?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Oh, read it!
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I see.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Who?
When was all this?
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Now, what would you like to do?
Oh, immediately.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Mine?
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
What are these people?
Oh George, come on.
He's dead.
Well - I mean—
Uh-huh.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
What about the porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
You're wrong, George.
What was that?
was saying—
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
That fellow got on at Baskul.
In for what?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
What is?
Bump?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Cowan--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Helluva night, isn't it?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Sir--
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I taught kindergarten.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
You don't know me at all.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
He's here to help!?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
What is it?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Er. well, nowhere special.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
They're not my pals--
Will it lower the curve?
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Which way?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Where's he making his big speech?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Wally!
What?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
About who?
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Victim's a white female.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Don't worry, Lamar.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm fine.
And who the hell is that?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
You can't run --
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
What?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
You set me up...
I need your help.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
So?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Sean -- you're not real.
It's a little late for that.
What the hell.
Sean, wait...
What's so funny?
-- and then walk out.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Which one is that?
Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
We can stop him.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Since right after we lost our son.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
You're Bobby, right?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
We have snifters
Not on me, sir.
What, sir?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
I don't get it. What do you do?
We're in Fashion.
What the fuck was that about?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Bullshit.
No.
I don't know.
You talk to Max today?
With what?
Goodbye, Bobby.
What'd you say?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Brooklyn.
This is it.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Yeah. Sure.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Take a few days --
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Can you check?
How am I being shitty?
I know the number.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I got no idea.
I'll page you with the number.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
We need guns.
I think we might.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Nice work.
Right here's fine.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
They asked who it was.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
He woulda told us right?
You too?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
We're getting whacked.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
No. I'll wait here.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
You want to come splash around.
I want to leave right now.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yes?
Excuse me.
Why? What I say bad?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No, really, mate?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Good morning.
Is it nice?
The Soho Grand?
No. What is it?
That money is your per diem.
She poured it for --
Dip?
Keeps me out of the army.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Yes, sir.
What you talking?
Let Billie finish.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
That's what Mama used to say.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Do you?
Could we sit down someplace?
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Why do you ask?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
It won't be easy.
I'll be away a lot.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Let's cancel.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Get out.
Did you hear me?!
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Let me die then.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
You're too small to be Bogart.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
He told you that?
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
He's bright.
I don't know shit about you.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
Where does he live?
[What's the PIN number?]
[The what?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Who ordered it?]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[Don't lie to me!]
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So how's business?
You been working?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
What are you doing here?
Creasy?
Pinta...
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Why not?
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
They'll be back in a week.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Did you used to?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
Rosanna Guerrero.
It's Creasy.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
When?
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
I think it's nice he's American.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Oh, yeah.
Waddaya gonna do now?
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Who you gonna call?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Ah?
What they say?
Marty.
Yeah.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Please...
Nothing.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Put on your blue suit...
Marty...
So these two girls come over to the bar...
What nurses?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
Well...
Waddaya talking about?!!
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Any time. Whenever we want.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Gimme three.
You betcher ass, Dad.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
I don't feel anything.
It's possible
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
They missed the boat.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's wrong with him?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Nice.
Did you get it, too?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Did you write this?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
What letter?
What John Doe?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
What John Doe?
Well, maybe you're right.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
I got it all ready. Here.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
Where is she?
Yeah, Boss?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
No!
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
I trust him.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I don't get it.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Did you write it—or didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, but—
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Hello, guys.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Could I please have a little water?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Don't make do it, Mike.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
It's all there.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Where did you hear that?
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
The 6 horse is still last.
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Have you evacuated anyone?
I know how you feel, Ray.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
When?
Stay here, don't move.
Prude.
Your concern is heartwarming.
You let us worry about that.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Repoed this morning.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
It's okay.
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Where the hell are you going?
You sure he's going to come?
Who?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Why would I do that?
Then where is she?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
What?
Why not?
Resurrection.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Standard, modern, upscale --
-- Standard.
So how can we get to it?
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
You own a hotel, sir?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
But ya got a Boss.
Charlie Luciano.
I had everything. Once.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I got my partner in there!
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
It's too late.
Who'll make the rules?
Meyer.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I found that out.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You disrespect our tradition.
Where's the stiff?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Anything!
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Who did this?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
DEATH!!
Back? You're sending me back?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Why?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Tell me what?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
The ring...
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
We like to think so, yeah.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Uh-huh?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know, you never tell me anything.
Mother, I ...
What's wrong?
Who is it?
What happened?
He's an organic farmer.
Where to?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Drunks are funny--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Okay. You don't mind?
Is the wind tired out there?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Huh?
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Jeff for Senator.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Mr. President!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Mr. President! A point of order!
Jefferson--
Is--is something the matter?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Tonight.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
I did--and--and I got right up.
He did?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
No!
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Great.
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
"So help me God."
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
No?
Oh, now--that won't do--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Do I actually *see* this--?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
No.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
I enjoy it.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
He played in the town band, too.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
I'm crucifying him.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
What're you going to do?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Boy, was he burning.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Perfect! Perfect!
I wanna see that guy!
Must we have the echo?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
No?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Me?!
Naturally.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Uh-huh.
That ought to be fun.
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota north.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
No, sir.
Looking for?
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Hey, did you hear that?
How did they threaten you?
Uh-huh. What are they?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Uh-huh.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Ernest, what do you think?
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Mr. Follett.
What?
Why? I'm paying for this.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
What?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
...so rich?
He told you.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Hello, Lionel.
That would explain it.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Ph.D., psychologist.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
When did you start to feel this way?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Please... forgive me.
I've offended you!
Sore throat?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Um-huh.
I'm glad.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
What was that?
You feel violated?
But...
Anything... just ask.
We're only talking about six weeks.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
It's called pro bono.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
What are you talking about?
How are you?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
This is great!
Don't you like this?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
I can tell you anything else.
But look at me now...
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
I guess that makes sense.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
That was a terrible thing.
Goin' somewhere?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Intestines.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Yes.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
I'm your sister.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
I found it, Evy! I found it
Where's my gun?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Do I?
We didn't think this through very well.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Hey... you okay?
Have you considered my offer?
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
It's home.
Me, too.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And it would be the right thing to do.
You sure that's how you spell it?
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So you're chicken?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
What's that?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Oh hi, Mom.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
She likes you.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
And there's the Sphinx.
Through there!
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Yes -- who spoke up?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
Cavalry?
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Who is there?
Yes, sire?
Yes, sir?
Oh -- where do you come from?
Hello there, Picart.
It is the work of incendiaries.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
And he sent you to me?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Will you be joining us, soon?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
My God, what do you think?
Oh, then you are...
Of course, my dear.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Anything you need.
And I can go free?
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
You paid cash?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Who are you?
No I'm not.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Man, this a cool house.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
I walked.
Yeah, air.
I said hold on!
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
You see that?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
He's inside the house?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Thanks for the help.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Elroy.
I threw my back, again.
Amtrack?
I appreciate that.
That's right.
For what?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
But...
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
Oh, man...
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Hey!
Everybody does?
You're a big girl, huh?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Leavin', boy?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
Yes! Yes!
How do you mean?
Who?
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
What could have possessed that girl!
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Tell me a story, John.
Hm?
Pearl! You ain't --
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
John, where's your folks?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Tell me what, boy?
All right...  Come along.
Nothin'. 
Yes?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
About our secrets.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
The first night?
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
I was praying.
Where's she at?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
None of your business, Madam.
This man down at the Drugstore...
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
You believe in anything?
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
You don't know he did it.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
What's the Coroner got to say?
Krueger.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Get into bed.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
You okay?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
What you mean 'all at once'?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Nice to have a fire.
What the hell you doing here?
An omelet.
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Or it might be the firing squad!
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
We don't like Razinin.
Misha! Misha!
What a lovely room you have here.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Yes, Leon...
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Yes, monsieur?
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
What business?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
How long do we have to wait here?
What?
No.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Why do you need my finger?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
And what is your profession?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Glorious, analytical...
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Why?
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Probably not.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
You see I couldn't shout that.
Ninotchka, I love you.
How do you do?
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Radio! What is radio?
Those newspaper people?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Months, Swana.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
No thanks, Swana.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
What is this, Swana?
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
We have nothing to discuss.
That's all right... I grow on people.
I must ask you to leave.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Where are they?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
May I ask why?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
This will do. 
He told me to take you to his conference room.
To protect his people.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
I like it.  I like the idea.
Why not?
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
The country's loving it.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
That's right ...
I know it well, sir.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
You never told him?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Sir?
Because they're not Americans.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
What?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
I beg your pardon --
There's no other choice.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Just ... uh ... you know.
He was a politician.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
How many?
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
Of them.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
I want a divorce.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Yeah ... I'm out.
You don't have to go.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Can I just ask for one thing?
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
It'll be over soon.
How many a those things you got now?
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Nineteen zero and nine.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
He's real all right.
Oh yes.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Would you tell me if you had?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Yes ma'am, I do.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
What about yours?
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
...This month's checks.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I put it in, Mama.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
To your husband.
Did you buy that gun?
Llewelyn!
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Odessa.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
What makes you say that?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
Why would I let you do that?
Yessir?
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
How much?
Sir?
...What time do you go to bed.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Yes.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
...Where you want me to put it?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
What room?
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Yessir.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Waitin' for my wife.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Sheriff, I don't...
You should get the order you want.
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
We think we know where Betty is.
What about it?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
"Thirty-two?"
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Do what?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
No, Del.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
What happened when you were twelve?
Didn't I?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Why are you doing this to me?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
...well, then you ain't got much.
I don't know.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I left my husband two days ago.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
You made out alright.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Who?
What? Where was he?!
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Huh?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
What do you mean?
Could you give us an example?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hell of a way to die.
...that's a good motto.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
How'd they describe her?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Seems like a nice place.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Yeah? The sport utility?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Huh?!
How'd he know about the treasure?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Yeah, look at me.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
'N turned into a frog -
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Suckin' away.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's not my ring.
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Yes, but honey -
You didn't know that at the time!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Pete... I do apologize.
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Who's the honcho around here?
...Yeah?
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
What did you call me, boy?
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
What other issue is there, Sid?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
He ask you out for next weekend?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Seriously.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I bet you do!
I can't risk it.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Jets.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Th --
-- posed to mean?
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Where did you get this clown?
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
Huh?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Master bath.
Oh, I've seen these...
Cut it back a little bit.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
We're leaving.
Ever read any Poe?
That room!
What do they want?
"What we want is in that room."
Say fuck.
Oh, please.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Got him!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Why?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Uhh... I with it sister but...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yes sir, I did.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
You mean...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We need money first...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Yeah.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Sorry man...
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
You don't look alright.
Yeah.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Colonel will do.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
That one is a bit more difficult.
I consider them linked.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Sir?
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Perhaps.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Did your father teach you humility?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Go on.
Balderdash!
Gabriel.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'm sorry.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Don't worry.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Who might you be, little Miss?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
I don't get it.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
God, that's fine.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
You folks ready to go on?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
I don't know.
I'm not climbing that.
It's funny, all right.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Why, then, things should be fine.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
She's finally asleep.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Now?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
I'll drop it!
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Boy overboard!
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
It doesn't!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
A fool's errand.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
How?  The key's run off.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
No.
Jack!
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
What are you going to do to him?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
That might work.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Aaabout...?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
The big house?
The big house.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Yeah.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You're insane.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
No cheese.
That's going to fit me?
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
What in the...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
We were different people then.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Oh, Mother!
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Well, I should say!
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Yeah?
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Dawson, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Yes.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Here you are.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Surely, come right in.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
We just thought that—
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Double-strength!
Stop calling me Mother!
Well done, sir. Very neat.
No, sir!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
No, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Yes sir.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Bud brought it to me.
She's crying.
How was your day?
Oh, George ...
I told you where I was.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
What?
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
Are you alright?  What is it?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
What?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
What were you doing in a library?
Jen please ...
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
So what's it like?
Yeah.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
They just grow like that?
Can I open it?
You're gonna forget about me.
McIntire's.
Where are you going ...
... Hi.
I can't.
Look ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
There's worse places.
Yeah ...
Yeah.
I'll never be able to do that.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You just said very food.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Why?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I don't know.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Yeah I can't.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
...just talking to you....
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
No.
Georgia.
I'm going to work.
You're going to work now?
Yes.
-- you said you did.
Are you telling me no?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Business is good, you're busy?
Yeah, not really.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
You were talking about the promotion --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Hello?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I just wanted to make sure.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I think maybe over a hundred.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
For what?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Yeah.
Well who did?
I don't know.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
What do you mean?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
That was weird. I meant good.
It's alright.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You're goin' on a trip?
So what should I do with the pudding?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Where you goin?
Yeah.
Hey.
You have an ATM?
Is this where you live?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
I thought Latisha said you would --
Nothing.
We should be going --
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
His rug.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
He'll do no such thing.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Is it awfully violent?
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
I am not a wealthy woman.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Oh, but I am!
I am eternally in your debt.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Very much.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Not you too
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Uh-hub.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Then you explain it to me?!
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I will not defend my life to you--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Thank you for your time
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
What are movies about?
Showing life
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Mank-
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
I don't have it anymore?!
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
I'll hire you  -- right now-
They don't have to.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
The title?
Craig is one syllable
Uh huh.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
So they're Jews. . .
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You're going to destroy it
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
For the title
Then find another theater
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
How 'bout a real drink?
We're from...
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
What's up, Colonel?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Where you going at this hour?
You want me to do what?
Jack, I got no gloves.
You wasn't with her?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Whatcha doin'?
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
At night?
I just wanted to say hello.
Now take the rest off.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
You asleep?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I went to the movies.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Why don't you just call him up?
Open the door, Vickie.
But they don't have a case against you.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Jefferies?
But his leg!
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
Thanks.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Your Lisa?
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I'll send you some comic books.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
That's normal.
No.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Police?
What?
Hello.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Well?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
Yeah.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Smashed the front door.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Hey--I want to ask you something.
What would you do, Dad?
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You sure?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Is he there?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Boy!
No.  It's perpetual motion.
What?
How'd you get here?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Who's that!
Yeah?
I came here before.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Who's that?
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Wash up and go home.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
No.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
What?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Yes.  My best friend.
Plato, where's your father now?
Do you think your father means that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Good evening.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
You promised me!
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Toys for... adults?
Negative five?
No, no --
Do that again.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
You need a COAT!
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
They've never done a robbery?
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
He says he wants it now.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
No --
But I never said Rudy.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
I had better sex in prison.
What's her middle name?
Samantha.
What's her greatest fear?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What?
They won't recognize me.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Might as well be.
You do.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No way.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
That motherfucker --
How long ago was your makeover?
Haven't thought about it.
Not yet.
What?
Just a roach, Zook.
YOU TELL HER!
...for Christmas...
I... sorry, Mister...
That was my king!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Seymour Scagnetti.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
We can work this out, can't we?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What about?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
He don't tip.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
That's not correct.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I think he's just passed out.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Of course.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
And one of 'em is sick.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
You can stay here if you like.
Our kind of women?
So am I.
Will she be dark or fair?
You're not going out to look for them?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
How does she draw?
Who's Lednov?
I don't want to run short.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Why?
Finished, son?
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Even women?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
They shouldn't have done that.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Go on. Have another try at him.
Everybody knows --
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Aren't we stayin'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
And you've got me all figured out?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Alex, what are you doing?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Really? That's amazing.
Shhh... It's okay.
No, stay.
You sure?
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Feel that?
Listen to me I --
Then what are we going to do?
Hey, look out, a bee!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I don't care. You pick.
Stop touching his brain!
Both of them?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Huh?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Right. What about condoms?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
My God! Is she dead?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What?
Yours, or the turkeys?
I'm so glad you're here.
How is she?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Because she will lie?
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
It says, "Ray."
"Ray!"
What a bitch!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Why?
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
But Mom, the video's not over.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
CHIP!!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
He goes to college with me!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Shhhh..
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
"P" as in...
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
He killed people, Mom.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Yes, but I lent it...
Mrs... Sutphin?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Certainly not!
What's he know?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
You think my sister is there?
Can we go there now?
When I wanted to.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
But you have treated me that way.
I'd like that.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Yes.
But I'm not joking.
And then?
Good-bye.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
My window - - through which I see the world.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Uh—huh.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
You know where she is?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
It seems right to us.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Ann?
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
You're what?
Are you in the middle of something?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
And they just answer them?
You know?
Yes.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Did you have sex before you were married?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
About me?
Why not?
How come?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
You're really never going to make love again?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I want to touch you.
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
But I'm not.
Loud.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
No, I haven't.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
I guess.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, what, then?
What kinds of questions?
I can't believe you did that!!
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
You are in serious trouble.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Do I know you?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
How did you find me?
Nothing.
You just want to ask me questions?
That's all.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
No.
No.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
I'm intrigued.
Hello.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Did he put you up to this?
Plenty of room for two people.
Will you lease month-to-month?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're the one who found the bodies?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Anything wrong?
Well? Supper at my place?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
He was a President.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.
Shove it, Ralph!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I NEED SOME
I'm...happy.
Brad!
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
I love you.
Miles.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
My condolences.
Say, is Maya working?
Is it chicken?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
I can't help the traffic.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
How do you know?
Have you no shame?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
So what should I wear?
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Can you give me some room here?
Shut up.
What is it?
We're on.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
What's up?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
Well?
Huh. Let me think.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
The plan is... you go.
No, I'm okay.
What the fuck!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.
Love you, man.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
You want to join us?
Hi.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Thanks.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Okay. See you around.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Where are you?
Hello?
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Both.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
Hi sweetie.
...I will.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain noises.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
How can you say that?
We won't be able to get out of there.
Me too.
It needs batteries.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
It's not broken.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Okay.  So he was tall?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Why not?
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
What book!
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
What friend is that?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
More than enough.
My name is Emmett.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
No, Leavenworth.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Who?
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Why?
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
The other guy drew first.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
All I did was kiss the girl.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
What about his brother?
You've got a legitimate job.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
What is it you want from me?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Who's the owner?
You really are a gambler.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Of course.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Almost right.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Everyone you know is lying.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Where are you?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Body double.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Why not?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Good for you, Hank.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Is she here tonight?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
You know me -- married to my work.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Don't you?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Long live the First Amendment.
Mr. Sayer...
What do you want -- ?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Simone.
I am the death of real.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
He hates me.
Words.
What?
What makes you think that?
What?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
What?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
You see ghosts, Cole?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Sounds familiar.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Curt Cobain.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Never heard of it.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
What is it?!!
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Starla, it ain't --
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Who's the lucky fella?
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
I never danced in a towel before.
Okay.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Kate McConnell.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Well?...
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
Where you from?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
What the hell are you doing?!?
How do you know?
Why are you stopping?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
I'm begging.
What's your pleasure?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
He's history.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
Then don't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
Anything on the Swede?
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Who?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
What'd you say?
Okay.
Do you want me to say I did it?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
I can't discuss --
-- You can and you will.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
You got clicks, anything?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
... Jesus... what for?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
What were you doin' here anyway?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
No, she won't.
He's dead.
What?
Where's Sartorius?
How much sleep?
Shut up.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
They come when you sleep.
Jesus...
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Why?
To calm your anxiety.
Rheya...
Is it a planet?
Where've you been?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Why did you say those things?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
What does Snow think you should do?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
What's happening to us?
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Are you nervous?
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Claire?
Urdu and Hindi.
They're kind of fuzzy.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
What's to like?
Stop being nuts!
What do you want to do?
Claire...
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I don't know...
I like your coat.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Get in bed.
So how'd it go?
Why?
Coming to bed?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
Who's Joey Venza?
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
No, sir...
Let my kid go.
What're we having?
She's what?
And Flash isn't?
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
No…not really.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
You're making my life difficult.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
My my.
But you like that in a man?
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Hello, Liz.
Waldos.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Peter, what can I do for you?
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
So they're airing this tonight?
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Come on!
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Brother, were we all wet about you!
How much more do we have to take from him?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Say, Schulz --
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No?
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You did?
She'll never forgive me!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
What about Schulz?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
What radio?
Anybody call?
You did!
You off your rocker?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
December seventh, forty-one.
What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I get it. I get it.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Well, may we have a look around?
Antonia?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Kirk here.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Report.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Will we get another ship?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
Could it be Spock's?
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
I'll handle that later.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Close... There --
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Then, how --
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
Yes... But -- how...?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
I ordered no interruptions.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
500 Kellicams!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
You're not going in there -- !
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
And who am I hiding from?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Does that about do it?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Jim --
So are we, it looks like.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Thirty seconds...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Any suggestions, Admiral?
You earned it.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
How?
All stop, sir.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
We are clear and free to navigate.
He's very human.
Certainly...
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
-- That's the general idea.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Hi... Busy?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can you isolate the wave?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Status report, Admiral!
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
I buy that. What about him?
Thanks.
Iowa.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Do you trust me?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's what?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Spock...?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Admiral! There be whales here!
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
With pleasure.
Hi.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Don't panic...
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
... an offlander?
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Data doesn't breathe.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
You're not going to launch anything until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
What kind of concerns?
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Fail-safe?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
You need a haircut, Commander.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Counselor?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
I believe so.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I told you, there's no --
Ready to make a little history?
Always am.
What's still there?
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Main bus...
Great name. French?
Where in the States?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
We're still in Earth orbit.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Mr. President.
What the Hell's going on?
Figures.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
What is it with you, anyway?
ARE YOU CRAZY?
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
WHAT HAPPENED?
What?
You were demoted...
Torpedo room--?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
An accident wasn't good enough...
How much time's left of your sentence?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Aye, sir.
I hope you're happy.
WE volunteered?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I SHOULD have been -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
Channel open, Captain.
Captain --
Praxis?
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Because you are dangerous.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
And this makes you "sad"?
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
An individual more like you, you mean.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Understood.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Strength in numbers?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
We need to talk, just you and I.
It's not quite the face you remember.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Hello, Jean Luc.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
Please.
Are we prepared?
How long?
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
For the moment.
Benny, there's nothing there.
What can I do for you folks?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Stay right there...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Hello George.
George... Do you hear me, George?
I just retired.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Pancakes.
Money.
Minneapolis.
No gas.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Are you from up there? Space?
Space?
A drink.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
No... The closest...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
Go?
It's bad.
What are you doing?
I like this music.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
You're damn right I am.
Horses.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Call the police!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Was there visual contact?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
We can't let you do that.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Forget it's there.
You talked to Iris?  When?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
No.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
That's not sayin' much.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
What do you mean?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Black.  Jack.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So that gives you something.
So the guy's not a sicko.
What is it?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
This is bad.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
What?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Yeah.
I've been looking for you.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What did he look like?
He was sitting here?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
I don't believe this.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
I was looking for a pattern.
I understand.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
You work with Koessler?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
And one other thing.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
I know.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
It's quite advanced.
Kulok.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Suspect Zero?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
I don't carry it with me.
I already have an employer.
Lead the way, Murman.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
"MyDick?"
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Don't do it, Mike.
What do you drive?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
What else?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
You haven't told then, huh?
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
On the table.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Yeah. And an actor.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Hello?
Lorraine?
Yeah?
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
...the Michelin commercial...
So I don't call either way.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Why?
I do. Good for you, man.
Uuuuugh!
Oh boy.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
It's kinda money, actually.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Mike?
Don't call me ever again.
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
You're crazy.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
...gotta...
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
Sorry about interrupting...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She didn't like me, anyway.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Michelle went for you, right.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
You guys are such assholes.
You looked right at her, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
It's not like that...
They're a finesse team...
Is she looking at me, baby?
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
No.  You ask for too much.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
Should I bring him in.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
But you needed a drink first.
Barzini.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Who are those girls?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Was there a definite proposal?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
What was that?
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
What about McCluskey?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
They're waiting to see my father.
Who is he?
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
And what do you want for Christmas?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
I'm thinking about it.
How is your father?
Please say it.
When will I see you again?
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
We're going to New Jersey?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
We?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Hi Tom.
It's vile.
I don't like you.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Your parents met her.
Sure. I love Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
No!
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Ha.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Far cry from New York.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I hope she never knows.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Where does Dickie live?
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Marge? Where are you going?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Is Freddie in Rome?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
That's good, isn't it?
What did he say?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Do you want me to stick around?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Even her.
November 7th is my information.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Huh?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
What?
What are you doing?
This is sort of high class...
Well... mostly...
What about the record?
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Oh, are you all right?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
20 bucks?
I don't remember.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Well, I tried.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
God, you are square.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
How?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
No.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
I can't sleep nights.
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Why?
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I know.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Neither do I, I guess.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Could we change the subject?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Do you... remember me?
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Do you have the...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
No wallet, huh?
Are you saying that he's...
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Didn't you have any help?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Ernie.
You bet.
Well...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Zackly.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
That's where you live.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Huh?
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
When'd you quit smoking?
Not at all.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Oh.
It's about me.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Yes?
Yes?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Yes.
Miss Daniels?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
I don't know, honey.
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Thank you.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I'm simply quoting the law.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Then he saw.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Did you close the door?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Sixty...  Oh.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
When?
I didn't break that window!
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What are you? A policeman?
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
How do you know Annie?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
Will I be seeing you again?
Oh. That. Rome.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
What did it say?
But not for me.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
You have a job?
You look a little shaken.
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Mmm?
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie, Melanie...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
I think it's safe to get out now.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
You must be exhausted.
Mitch...
Can we turn back?
You said three o'clock.
Yes, certainly. 
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Scotch, light on the water.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I'm cold as ice.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.
We can't be sure of that.
You've no thought of going there?
Why, yes.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
A pleasure to torment me?
Only Brother.
Yes, Doctor.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Two down. Two to go.
Where the fuck did you come from?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
What's with your friend there?
Look, can I just call a cab?
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
I leave that in your hands.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Of course, dear.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think they'll ever find him?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
How does he explain that?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Hello--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Who?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
You sure about that?
That's right.
They would have killed this man?
I don't like horror comics.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
We still going?
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
What's going' on?
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
He's not glowing.
Who, Laddie?
See you later.
Okay?
Ocean air!
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Where's Michael?
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
But you passed the test!
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I'm Michael.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Michael?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Anybody sick?
Somebody broke in.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let's open it.  Now...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
What are you doing?
What clothes?
Hey, Sweden!!!
A couple of hours.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
What if it doesn't come?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Get back!!
The generator!
Calm down and get in your position.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Yeah!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
What?!
What do you do on the towers?
Ah... no.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
But you're only a mud carrier.
This is it?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Last night.
So, do we go on?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
This is the way in?
Yes.
Why did they built it?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
No, we created the Morlocks.
As slaves.
How?
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
I need to... um... talk to you.
A moonstone.
Got here as soon as I could.
You know I can't.
Darling.
Alex...?!
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
In the future, we'll be better.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
I'm sorry, David.
For God's Sake, David --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
I would.
This... was my home.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Your husband is dead?
Oh, that explains everything.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
What are you?
Learning was important?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Yes.
So you can use it now?
It was different then.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
I did...
Why?
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
What about Starks?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
What should they be looking for?
I need to get this letter to someone.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
I gave you my dog tags.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
What?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
How?
Why, what would you do?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
And how do you know that?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Don't you go to jail for that?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Becker does? Are you sure?
Can you drive?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'll manage.
What's this?
Yup. That's me.
Well, good for you.
I'm sorry.
Have a good day at work today.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
What?
Yes, baby?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Will you at least see how it fits?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
Okay.  I will, too.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Which part?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Yes.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Will I be?
So what are you gonna tell him?
Drive!  Drive away!
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Yeah.
You mean now or before?
Like a Chihuahua?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
You know what's happened, don't you?
Shit!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You women are crazy!
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Never?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I don't know.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
What?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Got cash.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Healy you dog!
Thanks.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
The sawbones?
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
You own a home there?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
You're a movie buff?
What?
All set.
Urrggghh...
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
No.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
What are you doing?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Hey, hey, hey!
What do you mean?
How'd you manage that one?
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Ho-ly shit.
What?
Thanks for picking me up.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Where's Puffy?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
And did everything -- ?
By the way, how's he doing?
Yeah?
So you're a writer?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
What what are you doing here?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
What?! No please, sir --
Piggyback ride.
Starshells.
Good.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Well, I'm not.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Smoke.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Forget it, Scotty.
Let's get out of here.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
I don't like what's happening.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Hey.
Hey. Nice tie.
Rug samples.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
When did we get that?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Alright. Alright...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
She's that subtle?
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
Why?
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
Ray...
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Still after Jimmy?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
What about the water...
You take care.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
It isn't?
I could be, too.
I saw one.
Yes, ma'am.
What would?
Evan... or Maverick.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Let's make it at eight.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You're totally insane.
You want to go ballistic?
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Well no...inverse order.
That's not what I hear.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
No.
What?
Hardly ever.
One more.
Well... What   is   it?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes sir.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
What is he doing?
What is?
Were upside down!
I'm pulling up.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
I've got it -- hold on!
The plane is fine.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Tom Kazansky.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Great move. Great
Come on, relax...
Come on, we're next.
Time to go.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
Three guesses.
Helping him in.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
I lost.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
No bother.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
I know.
What's wrong with this one?
What to the rebels want?
The Last Resort.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Thank you.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Hetero.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
You tell me.
I don't know.
They sell fake memories.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
You went to Rekall, remember?
Harry, what the hell is this?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Would you please repeat the destination?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
What's in the two week package?
As real as any memory in your head.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Blondes.
What are you talking about?
This is too weird.
Why would I lie to you?
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
I gave you?
Or a big mother slug maybe?
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
She's got my vote.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I might have an idea...
Oh my God.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Don't he have a home to go to?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Like hell you are.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Civil?  I'm civil.
What?
The con...!  Oh my God.
What?
You sure this is where it was?
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
I brought it... to the coroner.
He was your snitch.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
I have to talk to your brother.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
Oh really?
I specialize, Roger...
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
We're taking the other case.
1530 Rivington Street.
But what?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
What's Art Esparza?
-- What?
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
You do.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
-- Every word.
What do you want?
I followed you here from court.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Bobby's got it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
Someone else has it now.
Where's Hap?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
No.
No.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
How do you figure?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
That's good.
Take a look at this.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
James called me last night looking for you.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
WE got it back, that's all.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Bob.
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
We were supposed to be together.
I can't tonight.
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
No.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
A friend from school.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Are you sure you're okay?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Nothing.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
How did you settle on the amount?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
Yes.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
How is that?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Huh!
Say it.
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
...that's all right.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
The Doctors were not negligent.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am seventy-four years old.
And you wrote that...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
I'm sorry...?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
What?
I object, your Honor...
D'you find an apartment?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
Why don't you get some rest?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You, you don't under...
No... no...
This is Miss Costello...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Nothing happened.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
...You saw her?
...fifty thousand dollars?
I want to buy you a drink.
...now who is that...?
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What are you doing in New York...?
I just saw her.
...of the procedures...
Yes.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Is that it over there?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
They've all stopped at the same time.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Is that... machine...?
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
No.  I thought you had them.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
They are living creatures out there.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
What'll we say to 'em?
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
You mean that was a...
No.
Home.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
In what, a romantic comedy?
You didn't jump in.
Listen, dammit.
What's that?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
It can be captured, sometimes.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Did we lose anybody?
We were idealists.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Me either.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
He does.
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Do what?
What are they doing?
You all right?
Well, spit it out.
They have every right Chuck.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Me, too.
I couldn't do it.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
They tell you that?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
How long you been standing there?
But, they don't speak English.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Suicidal...
No.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Swing up, son.
What?
No.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Easy for you to say.
Artie? That you, Artie?
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Need a hand?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
No sir...
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
That bastard Pucinski...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
And?
Why, honey?
What brand'd she smoke?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
Here she goes again...
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
What's that, peanut?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
That don't smell like a More.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Lula, you there?
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
You think she's gonna make it?
Yeah?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Love you, too.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You must be my son.
I'll bet.
Mama???
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Got any plans?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
What if I asked you not to?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What do you want me to do about it?
Take care of him?
Yes.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Where?
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Santos... I can't...
Where we goin'?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
He's fine. He's narrating.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
I thought you were tinkering.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
That was good.
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Which is?
So what's the problem?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
...we find the jacket.
Naturally you have copies.
How are you -- is it Joe?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
You driving this car?
And your wife left you.
Is that in my chart?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Who the hell is that?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
I'll miss my bus.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Washed up?
Blocked.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Humboldt County?
Carvel.
I never heard of it.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Kinship.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I never said that.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
You coming?
Want a bite?
I eat.
I'm not going with them.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Near Carvel?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
You got me.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I think I might have.
I lost it all.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
James is... I don't know...
I'm not sure that's possible.
Listen, Antonia --
He's writing his name in water.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Hey, is that a school?
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
How old is Anna?
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
You need a table.
What party?
Next week? The week after?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Isn't it?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Nothing.
How does it sound?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
I haven't broken any laws.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Do you believe in them?
No.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You knew her?
You don't know?
Know what?
What's with the boxes?
It sounds like you were banished.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Bad idea.
You think reflection is good.
How's that?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
I couldn't say.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
That's not a helpful answer.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
I don't see --
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Very weird.
Are you?
You plan to drink both those beers?
I get that impression.
What?
So, you're not a dyke.
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
Twelve years in prison?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
You must hate your brothers.
What?
You're scared.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
What's going on?
Do you want to talk about it?
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
How you guys doing?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
You wanna know what I think?
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
Fine.  Be that way.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
I think it likes you.
They'll come out after us.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
What's the plan?
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
SHIT!
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Getting a reading?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
He can still make it.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
But where are you going?
Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Are you feeling better?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Oh, Sandro...
Claudia, let's get married?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
What are you saying?
Why?
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
What happened?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Are you the owner of this place?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Your mother?
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
But she watches... she listens.
I'm not hungry.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Should you see a doctor?
No I don't.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Right now?
Yes.
He's told you?
Where do you meet?
I went to my room.
Agnes...
Martha Louise Livingston.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
You have trouble sleeping?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Because I don't want one.
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
I'm not sick.
What did you do?
You can tell me.
She can't hurt you any more.
Yes?
That you're a mistake?
Yes.
Yes I am.
To help me.
Of what?
Why were you afraid?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Someone's following me.
No.
What do you do?
So I could go to him.
Where?
Are you frightened?
No...
I hate him.
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Marie's dead Mama.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
The one up on the third floor?
Is that normal?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
None as far as I know.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
That's ridiculous...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
When was that?
You lied to me
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
Why would I lie?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
That's a lie.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Why aren't you at work?
The police station.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
We're nearly there, sir.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
You do - repeatedly.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Ta.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Sorry.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Is she?
And cunning.
Ah.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Have they?
Hello, Grandfather!
And we're looking after him, are we?
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Hello.
Aye, but you know him well.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Don't exaggerate.
Where's my grandfather?
None for me, then?
That's mine.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Locked.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
What is it?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yeah!
Dead.
Oh -- God -- oh --
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Hey, guess what?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
So does anybody have any suggestions?
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Hey now, what is this?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
It will be.
I've completely lost their signal.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
We can use the flamethrower.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
That sounds a little fanciful...
The commander normally has first publication rights.
How?
Are they close?
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Good!  Moisture content?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Found what?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Engaged.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
Where are you?
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Now what?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
You win some, you loose some.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Has anybody talked to them?
Oh, man...
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Yeah?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
What the hell are you doing?
Wait.  Lost it.
It's alright, it's cool...
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
What happened?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Thanks.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Agreed.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
How's it going?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
I don't think that's funny.
What time?
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You sat and talked until it was light...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
No-no-no...
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Let's go sit by the piano.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Then you've heard too.
Margo.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
How nice.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Good luck, genius...
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
That I am...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Happy birthday, darling...
How is Eve? Okay?
It's a good thought.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Addison-!
Don't calm down.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Groom.
Hello, what's your name?
Is it the money?
Ah...
Are you proud of me, Bill?
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
So am I.
I'm for it.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
What did you expect - live sables?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
You don't like Eve, do you?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Don't be dense. The party.
How did you get in here?
You were just looking around...
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Something most important you can do.
How'd hear about it?
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
The curtains. I made them myself.
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How much time have we?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
What about Bill?
Why should he - and why should you?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
Lloyd, what happened...?
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Eve?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
Now just a minute-
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
How's the new one coming?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
To you, too?
That's beside the point.
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Promise.
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--a spy, you mean?
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
What's that?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Go on, go on--
How do you want to handle Sloan?
You want me to be the bastard.
How high up, which Republicans?
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
What's the matter?
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
Hmm?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
And you will.  But not now.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
I didn't.
But you know who did.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Can't help you.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
--you don't really think you're being followed?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
One minute but then--
What do you want to know?
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
To cover up?
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
What's this?
I got Clawsen on hold--
So?
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Howard Hunt here.
It is.
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--who you got?--
Anything?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
More denunciations?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
I'll do it.
Sure.
What did you just say?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
You're missing the game for us?!
This isn't any better, Chris.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
No you haven't.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
You're so big!
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Hey, minuteman.
What the heck is this?
Dad!  I know!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Yes.  Seriously.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
No...you...go...ahead.
Shame on you!
Move with the music.
Tonight?
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Like how?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Qualify for what?
Dude, prom sucks.
NOVA!!
That junior chick?
Bullshit.  From where?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Ha-ha!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Sure. I can follow that.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Like an underground club?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Are you okay?
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Nothing's happening!
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Claude.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Every Russian family has one..
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Bartok... a question.
What was that?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
What do you want?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
No. Empress, you --
She does.
I did no such thing!
Hey, you on television?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Well, then, w-who was?
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh - you're an actress.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, right.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
No, I got time.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Really, do you think so, really?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
You- Do you love me?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
M'hm.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Yeah?
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Oooh.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Okay, let me have this.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, this place is great.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Oh-
You look very pretty.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
What-
My head is throbbing.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Hey.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Just give me the license, please.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh. What about?
Hey-
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Yeah.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
The movie.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Not this time.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Why would she care?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Don't you miss it?
So where is young Jonah?
Would you leave us alone right now?
Fuck you.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Escape hatch.
The suspense is killing me.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Excuse me?
There's a test, you know.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Not properly watered.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Otis!!!!
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It's a Calder.
I know.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Yes, she is.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Please, Ryan.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
And you know, he really does not.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
I've never done this before.
What am I, five?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
How do you do, Skye?
Of course it's alright.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
What?
Sally?
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Panes is here!
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Okay.
Everyday.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
You're a shit.
So tell me, how's it going?
Panes?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
I thought it was okay where it was.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
What do you mean, thank God?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Really?
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Affirmative.
...Not enough food?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
...I should?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Not there.  Under the mat.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
What gave you that idea?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Why?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Give what up?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Sure.
Are you all right?
Where?
No -- just come as you are.
I don't?
I guess so.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Are you all right?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Oh.
Where is your apartment?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
This?
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Put me down for Thursday again.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
Sir?
You left your wife?
Yeah --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
I see.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
I dig.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
No I didn't.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
What's her name?
I'm not sure.
Sure, Doc.
Where are you moving to?
No.
The party's over.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
How long has it been -- a month?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
All set for what?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Part.
Delta ?
No.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Chef.
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Can I go get those mangos now?
Flood.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Shot himself. What for ?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Who knows what's up there?
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Will they attack?
Which way? Right or left?
What cat  ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
I only met Kurtz once.
Would he remember you ?
Yeah, it still runs.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Yeah.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
We don't want to bother you any, we --
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
They far enough?
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
What'd you do for supplies?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
You knew him best.
That's me.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
His name is...
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
215  CONTINUED:
Avalanche season is coming.
119  CONTINUED:  
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
27   CONTINUED:
39   CONTINUED:
Six months.
The radio's on the fritz.
Stay here.
Thanks.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
-- Permanently?
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Does he have people?
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Have to get these wet things off.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
If Corbett's men find out --
What does this matter to you?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
There's what they're waiting on!
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I'm sorry.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Since forever.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
What's this?
So. Anything else?
No... no thank you notes.
I want you to go on this trip.
Two days.
You take off when you have to.
Are you still coming?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Never.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
What job?
Were you asleep?
I had to see you...
Because...
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
One night with me!
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
What?
Oh, is he dead?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Melvin...
Did you like it that much?
Why?  What happened?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
How long have you been freelance?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
What?
You would be.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
I know what happened.
A player?
Um, five.
Until a minute ago.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Yes.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Yeah.
It looks like white's game.
He was... taken.
I killed him.
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
More or less.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Women?  No... not really.
After that?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
You said you didn't trust it.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Yes.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
What do you think he's doing?
Okay.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
I told you, he will.
Yes.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did he explain how this happened?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
When did it start?
Uh-huh.
Why?
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
For what?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Right.
Can I ask you a question?
That's correct.
American currency.
You guys having a go a me or what?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Like Custer huh?
He was an electrician?
So?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
'cause you stink of booze.
It must be on the other side of this.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Let's split.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
Red or white?
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Holly!
What?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
What do you want me to do?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
What about me?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
There shooting at something.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
So am I.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No, I love you, really.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
It's not so much.
Can we charge admission?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Seems a shame!
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Uh-huh!
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Just yesterday.
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
I don't want to go.
Shall I look after the rest?
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
What if they expel you?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
The address?!
I don't want to have any conversation.
Why?
Like me.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
So what else is on this list?
No problem --
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You're really into God, right?
You're not in a very good mood.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
So you're talking to me?
I have to get you home by one.
We're doing something -- ?
You make me feel...
Where?
One of your secrets.
What are you going to -- ?
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Yes.
For pay?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
So what did we just make?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
Hi, Marty!
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
So what? We'd be rich!
Marty.
Where did you get this?
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Suzy!
I'll catch up with you.
I mean it.
Sure is pretty.
Jack.
Holly.
Sure.
Yeah.
Somebody else is going to get it.
What'd you put him in there for?
That's Montana over there.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Yes.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
New Jersey?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Got a casualty list?
This is so embarrassing...
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
He offered you money?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Sound a little what?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Are you sure –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
I – Mr. Lipnik –
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
What's your new book about?
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
Because you didn't love him --
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Why not?
Ice?
My wife used to call me that.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Aren't you going to thank me?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
No?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
No thanks.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Somebody has to die.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nope, can't say that I do.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
I'm going with you.
What do you want?
Keep your three o'clock.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Who are you?
What do you think?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
What's wrong?
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
That was my favorite part!
These are great.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Jean, your parents are here.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
How do you know?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I need a dealer.
A primate?
Yes, but as a black painter –
I'm not black.
Not what?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Yeah.
Who's that?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
What's your name, man?
Hi.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
I don't eat junk food.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
You don't have any!!!
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
It's cold.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Where's the fire?
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
We've met.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
No.  No glass on the inside.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
You have?
It's good to see you.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Pheromones?
I'm on break from-
Please be looking for me.
Keep it.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
You're loosing your cool
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
No sign of the snowman.
I see you knew him.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Like hell you do.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
The dreams again, sir?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Why, indeed?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Letters in the alphabet.
Mystery.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Now black rubber.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Just ones this beautiful.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
He sure did.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I don't want to remember!
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
How'd you find us?
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Odd desire for anyone.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
We got 'em!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
You are on drugs.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Hi,
Meaning?
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
What happened?!!!
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
Say that again, son.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Of course.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
That's not that much.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh, you first.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Beavis.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
She sure does.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Who sent ya?
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Oh no.
I don't think we survived the crash.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Did you get the paint?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
And live in what, our station wagon?
Yeah.
W... What is it?
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's your cousin.
Otho?
Otho'll know what to do.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Stepmother.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
... Oh? You've heard?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Do you know Raphael?
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
There's no need for a hospital.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Your family doctor?
Would you care for a drink?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
What is that?
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
I see.
Yes, very well, thank you.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Oh, good.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Yes.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
I agree.
Yes.
Yes.
I hope so.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
You heard?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
... Ben, really...
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... Would you take me on a tour?
Yes? What have you found?
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Good. Anything else?
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Who am I thinking of?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Hi.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
I want to try.
How was it?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Don't forget me.
What's that?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Dr. Lester...
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Yes, well...
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Who told you?
What'll you have?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
Hi.
This is important!
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
I've fallen in love.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No, I didn't know that.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
I have to see you.
Did you see the reviews?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Come on in.
Bad dream, darling?
I likes yellow.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
No, let her rest.
Mama let me help you.
Out where?
I know Denver.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
I run him off.
You?
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Leave off..
All he can. All he can.
No, You looking good.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
This is our concern, Dude.
The Gundersons.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Sir, please lower your voice--
Fuckin' A.
Where you going, Dude?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Different mothers, huh?
No, they--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
And was there anything of value in the car?
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Which one was Logjammin'?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
I was talking about my rug.
No it's fine, really, uh--
She most certainly was not!
And please don't call her my mother.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
The fucking point is--
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Wooden bridge, huh?
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Shit yeah!
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
He can't walk, Walter!
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Are you employed, sir?
Ah fuck it.
Well?  Aren't you?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Anyone else make it?
You're hurting me.
You came back for me.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
You got something in mind, Blade?
What the fuck you doing?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Yes?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
You should've killed her, then.
Get in. You’re leaving.
Pass.
Is something wrong, my friend?
"The Blood Tide".
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
What are you doing?!
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Please --
Then what is it?
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
So what do you use, then? A stake?
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
What happened to the power?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
Try, please, Anna--
--I'm not staying here!
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
That's a joke?
Cheery little place.
Jesus.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Get <u>out</u> of here!
For "James?"
Hold this.
--turn the camera off--
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
She got <u>paid</u>.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
For a blur?
He'll never know.
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
--bullshit--
Does she, goddamnit??
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
What was that?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
What?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
...You ever get tired?
Ray?... What time is it?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
Ray--
...You leaving?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
What night is it?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Now that don't make much sense.
For the money.
Yeah. Is it...
...What kind of fish?
...What did you do with the bodies?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
What's this?
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Thanks Meurice.
What?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You did? A human ear?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Frank gone?
What do you want from me?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
I sure don't hate you.
I'm doing it.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Dorothy. no!
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
On a ride.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
There ya go.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Maybe so.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
What happened to him?
I'm here, aren't I?
So. what's next?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Are you sure?
He got a little jealous.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
You like mysteries that much?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Greetings, Mr. George.
He what?
No honey, I'm alright.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Nothing like this back home.
Nothing like this back home.
Are you kidding?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
What did I tell you?
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
What's that?
What?
No?
Murder.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Where do I put this!?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Mexico.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Layaway shmayaway.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Yeah, maybe.
Sure.
And Diego?
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
George.
I don't think so.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
There's schools in California.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Yeah?
Are we good?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Sure. By shooting at me.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
A name?
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Yeah.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No questions.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Why would she want that?
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
I have.
No.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Is it Marsh?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.
For about one year.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Why not?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
That's enough.
No.
Oriental medicine.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
High school?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
He video taped you.
Yes.
I've tried it.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Something like that.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
How'd you meet Marsh?
Yes -- she did.
Can I see you later?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
You don't need anybody.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
The witness will answer the question.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
What's she like?
Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Why did you lie to me?
Not even if they're a dork?
Did Marsh use it?
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
'82.
Grateful!?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Carolyn!
They got heat in Michigan.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Francesca.
Oh. How old?
Then what happened?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
What?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
What made you ask such a question?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Have you ever been to that station?
But you don't mind.
What?
Sleep all right?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
He yours, sir?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Just some flies.
Where's the others?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Climb out to where?
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Jimmy, you've got --
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
You know I can't.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
How do you know?
And you believe her?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
What are we doing down here?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
I didn't sell it.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Where is it?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
You mean they weren't up here?
That doesn't make any sense.
The hell I can't!
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar, what are you going to do?
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
What did she do to you?
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
I had to.  You made me.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We were in a car accident --
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Now that's teamwork.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You're helping Rajeev?
You can't kill me yet.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
So this is temporary for you?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Thanks.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
Curious, maybe.
I wanted to apologize.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What about that guy this morning?
Even though he knew about you?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
Yeah.
Yes.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
What did Gino drink?
Not Caesar.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
I'm still here.
Oh, God.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
-- he went inside! --
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.
Treadstone.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
I don't know.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
MPG Capital.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
We thought you were gone for good.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I said ten thousand.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I won't hurt you.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
No.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Where are we?
So this is it, right?
Thanks for the ride.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I didn't know this would happen.
-- forget it --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx
Where did this body go?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
xxxxxx...
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What?
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
... And then some.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
What? How do you know my name?
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
In fact, killing people -
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Ah ...
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Am I?
What has Tuttle done?
Er ... no.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Yes.
Ah.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
No, really.
Look at that - right on time.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Oh God! What have we done?
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
What happened to you after ...
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
He is dead.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.

You want to take my console into your office?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
What were we saying?
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Mistake?
Whatever happened to you?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Er, yes ...
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Er, don't you want to search me?
But I could be anybody.
I mean it fixed itself.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
I know him. That's Noel.
You never know.
He's dead, huh?
Our Lady of Misery.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Don't seem so bad to me.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He one of them?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Last show of the night.
The brakes are shot.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
What do you want to break?
Do it!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You're in the stomach!
How <u>you</u> doing?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
Wait.
You know what I...
Yes.
Which would you prefer?
Okay.  Let's do me.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
This is important to me.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
They're not really going to call security are they?
I really have to go.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Nobody else had it.
Why so glum?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Hi.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
You okay?
Nervous?
I didn't think you'd make it.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
So what did you think?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Where are you?
I know.  I taped it.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Good night??!
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
How can you say that to me?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
I don't wan to discuss work.
Then you should stay here.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Where's the bathroom?
Tonight.
Oh it's enough...
I already told you I'm not.
Whaddya mean?
Anything new?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Oh yeah?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Are you ready?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
What's the matter with you?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
You didn't mean to what?
Yeah?
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can't talk right now.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Hi.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Oh, OK.
If you see him.
What's all the noise in here!
I don't think this is gold.
Suck!
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Come on, what was it?
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
Didn't you get my message?
Hi.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
I'll back that up.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Like what?
) What do you think?
What are we doing?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Ow.
None of your business.  God.
Where's the other one?
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Who we gonna beat?
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Put your head back.
A what?
Don't start with me again.
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
I can't work this.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I want to die.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
That's the plan.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
What's happening?  What do you want?
I can't!
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I never thought of that.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
I really was way way too too.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You said "Crash".
That's my leg.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Crash, I didn't think you--
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Aren't we all?
I want to be had.
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Which one of us?
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
You're a cocksucker!
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
You fuck!
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
I ain't hitting a man first.
She's playing with my mind.
No.
Eight and twenty-four.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Well, I'd rather not say.
What?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Hello.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Now this is just a signature card.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
No, no it's okay.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
That's right, yeah.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
And what'd she want?
Well...
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
We can't get rid of him?
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Right away. Okay?
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
What? What?!
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
Right.
...under?
With what?
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Get off of me! Stop it!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
The arrangement is over!
With Jennifer.
I had a... salad.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Okay, I'll -
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
This is not the way to treat people.
No.
Excuse me.
I just wanna get out of here.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
It's instinctive, you know.
Artie! Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
What?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
What're you gonna do?
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Are you sure?
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Nothin'.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
I did what you told me to.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
It means I got the money.
Right.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
He's sittin' by the phone -
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Ace saw Vegas one way.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Come here, come here.
She asleep?
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Hey.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Again!
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Hmm. Not bad.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
Women, huh?
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
We're waiting.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Yeah, this is better than rape.
God-damn..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
I loved you.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
I still have one left...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Stop.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Hey, Captain God!
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Any place.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
You could've killed us.
How do we get back to the freeway?
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
If you know that just back off.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Got your badge?
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
And that was the end of it?
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
God, if he doesn't come back --
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Your husband?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
There isn't any such person.
L.A.P.D.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm still okay.
Did you hear that?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
They did some great job of reforming you.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
That's a reasonable possibility.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Took preparation.
Where do we meet?
What time frame have you got in mind?
308-9962.
You'll see her.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Five minutes.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Who were you talking to?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
I'm in awe.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Government business?
The 405 is coming up.
Is that good or bad?
He's still looking, Col.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Take your clothes.
And what's it like?
Hi.
He's getting up.
No, I didn't --
Give me that look again.
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Maybe.
What would he think?
Want to look after you.
What is this?
What you thinking of, hon?
Kind of liked you as a girl.
Details, baby, details.
Probably.
Am I becoming repetitious?
I miss you, Jimmy.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
It's her, isn't it?
Yes.
Why?
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
So tell me.
You heard what I said, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Yeah.
Yes.
I promise.
Lucky you.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Fergus!
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Need to go across the water.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Leave us, Judie.
I know.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Leave her out of this.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
You were made for this.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
What the fuck is this?
So he knows your name?
So it was you all the time.
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
Right.
What's that?
Do what?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
So what's that supposed to mean?
We got simple tastes, you and me.
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
If they kill me --
Don't.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
I said shut the fuck up --
I could eat a horse.
No -- I guess not.
What's the matter?
You don't look so bad in this light.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Lord, you're stubborn.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Reggie -- listen to me!
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
You mean spies and things like that?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Because they're still here.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Oh. Then who's this one?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
No.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Yes.
Oh.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
I'm not fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
What are you doing?
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
I think Tex did it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
I don't believe it.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Meaning what?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
I was, too.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Charles is.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Where?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Peter -- are you all right?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
What?
Who is it?
I believe what he said.
What are you talking about?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
No -- no, I'm don't.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Yeah? What's that?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
You're grounded Friday night!
I want you to head right home after school.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She's not here.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
No, you couldn't.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
_ Your father raped someone?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
I was desperate. It was gross.
FINE. Are you?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
You know I want to go with you.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Mom?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Where are you going?
What?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
Why not?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
You ok?
Just thinking about something.
You can't bring it.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
You're being unfair.
At least somebody likes this shit.




Uh, huh?
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.

You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
All right.
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog ain't mean.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
...fine.
Okay, okay! 
Shut up.

Okay.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...waiting!
Oh, shit.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Get over!  Get over!
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old...
Come on.
Holy--!


...man!
He's crazy!

Uh-oh.
...did you?
 Yeah.
...hospital.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
...shit.
Not completely, anyway.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Hey.   Mason.

They're movin'.
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Arlo!



 That's why I didn't give it...
...to him. 
Stop.
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
...they come!
Okay...

Hold this. 
Us.  Owes us.
I think so too.
...-tiatin'.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Be cool.  Be--
...about him.
Vaughn.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
We've got it...
Exactly.
However, you are also non-en-...
Whoo-hoo! 
Any of them Richard Long?
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
Now listen to me.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
...-ple.
Grateful?
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
"Went away."  I like that.
Do you know what'll...
Pleasant surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
Hit him.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
...here!
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...dangerous.
Not tonight...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
I don't see my container.
...-spite the mouth.
No.

...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
...somehow. 
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.

 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...back...
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Where are you now...
Forty-seven.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Just find the girl.
How do you do that?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Jake, listen.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Hello, Jake.
Thanks, Lou.
No?
No. It was an accident.
Didn't you call?
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
What are you talking about?
Too late for what?
Well, let's go.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Iced tea.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, how much would you like?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Is there anything else you want to know?
For very long?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Then it was over the water department.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
Maid's night off?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
The Albacore Club.
I know.
You saw my fa... father? When?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Did you get some sleep?
Where's the girl?
I want to see her.
Going somewhere?
What did you do that for?
That's good. Now what's her name?
I'm all right.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Who?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
You're a married man, am I right?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
It's not completely dry.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Then go home and forget about it.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
But you don't have any kids!!!
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
No...
Will they really find work in Germany?
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
Father, I have sinned...
Elena!...But when...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
My husband...you know him.
So what's that got to do with it?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
Go on!
Three cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
You know why?  She was so -
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Wasted?
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
No, Mr. Kane.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Hello, Brad -
Almost two to one -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
What's funny now?
Oh!
Oh!
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't say.
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
I'll sign those papers -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
I know, but -
Yes and no.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
How did you meet him?
She's plastered, isn't she?
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Hey, now wait a sec...
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
God, isn't he great?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Nobody! I swear!
When did you get back?
I'm not pregnant.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Sang.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Who doesn't?
How'd you get here so fast?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Well he asked me for it!
This is the last time I come to this place.
Who are you to make assessments?
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
You only brought one ball?!
You're late.
Why are the shutters closed?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
What do you mean?
Oh, my God.
Oh yeah.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Blasphemy.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
More or less.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
And the second time around...?
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
No, you're not.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
She meant nothing to you!
You were saying?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Stop it.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
What's that for?
May I be blunt with you?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Because I'm here.
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
You just fucked a total stranger?
This life.
You should shit or get off the pot.
Fuck you.
As if it's that easy.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Like ten after.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Helluva day.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Just the paper.
I don't think so.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
A half hour.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Jesus... go ahead.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Really?
I was kidding.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Something wrong?
Including you?
What the hell was that for?
Who?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Something like thirty-six.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
What is it?
You couldn't get these shutters open?
What time do you get finished?
What're you talking about?
Would you let me explain...
I don't want to go back with her...
Randal...?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
What did he say?
Did he say "making fuck?"
He really wants to play metal?
Really?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I hope it feels good.
How long you gonna be here?
I... I don't know what to say.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Which one?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Answer the man.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
So, what do you see?
Go on, fetch.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I know...
I don't expect you to understand.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Resuscitation?
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He doesn't want my help.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
Remember the first time we came up here?
It was great.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Take the rope.
I won't do it.  No way.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You said there was a way across.
Travers, you're not running things.
Go after her.
I don't know about totally.
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Been punished, yeah?
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
My wife... Alex freezes.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
I did, sir.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Fair hair, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Fucking hell...
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Mothballs, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Pitiful rookerful...
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Most of the time.
Just had one.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
No.
The crowd had to dig it.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Something going on?
It's nothing.
I got caught up at work.
You're kidding me.
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
It's not that kind of job.
You always stutter?
What?
Max.
Try some deep breathing.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
How can you kill him like that?
I don't know any Rwandans.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
So what?
I don't understand...
No.
What you mean, no?
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
I'm sorry.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
Then what are you?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I was only going one way.
Saved you last night's, too.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Not for years.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
You going to warn him?
For what?
He says a dog bit his nose.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
Never heard of him.
Was that who I thought it was?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
That was him.
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He's why you punish yourself.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Right here in Manhattan.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Liza?
Did you kill him?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Back where?
Blue moon...
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
I love you, too.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Which way did he go?
Jonas?
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
I'm willing to take that risk.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Peter sends his regards.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
With me.
Ellie.
Actually I'm running late --
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
You...
What would you have me say, David?
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
You're not real.  None of this is.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Why?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
Ellie, what is it?
What?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Yeah.
We saw the broads.
Comin' out here, Boss?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Here, Captain.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
We got it locked in the sock.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
What pattern was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
You know I can't do that.
No.  Not yet.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
If he's not out, why are they here?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Is that it?
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
You're afraid of him.
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Who's the married man?
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
The lock...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Michael Johnson.
Who came in after you?
Answer it.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
Oh, maaaaan?!
Where you going?
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You should have gone to the funeral.
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
You haven't told me where we're going.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
What does he want from you?
I did this already.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
Will you get time off to do that?
Which flowers did you order?
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
We'll get caught.
Don't be ridiculous.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
No way.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Well?
So, it's over?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Michael.
Good luck.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
You can get out of the dinner.
Are you all right?
Especially this last year.
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
No, no.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
What does that mean?
What are you doing?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
You killed her!
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
It's Elvis...
You've already robbed the safe?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I'm not here to negotiate.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
They're gonna be what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
He missed three weeks.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
We can't.
Because you're the closest.
Why is everything an argument with you?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
This is Zero.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
I've got a way with people.
How much?
It's me.
-- Did you set it up?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Just find them!
Good song though.
The Holiday Hotel.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
They don't have a wine list.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
What is it you do, Sami?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
What the hell is he talking about?
How about Canada?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Mr. Taylor?
It's good.
How's my brother?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Uh huh.
How are we going to do that?
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
And you don't speak French?
I can't even hear myself think.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
It's for you.
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Yes.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
You, sister...
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
You were enlightened?
What was it?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Don't thank me.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
My name.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
How 'bout the morgue?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Mom --?
Mister Funboy.
No.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I don't know you.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
How the hell did you do that?
Yes.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
What... the hell is that?
An unexpected pleasure.
Who got himself what?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Are you okay?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Forever.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You a lesbo?
A friend wrote me.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
About what?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Need a lift?
You don't even know me.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I'm busy.
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Oh please.
What?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm sorry about that.
Greg McConnell.
Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Why?
I did?
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Same time next week?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Hi, mom.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Who is this?
I told you I don't know.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Where is she?
Bad time?
No, I'm not.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Yes, you already did.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
What are you talking about?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
What are saying, darling?
Mommy --
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
But I told her to go with you.
Amy, not that old tree!
It was just a voice.
No, I didn't.
But there's no one here, darling.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
That's right!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
It stands so still.
Yes, Amy.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Who is she?
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
The Headless Horseman --
Why hasn't he got a head?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
I hate the storm. I hate it!
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Mother! You called me by name!
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
What does that have to do with me?
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Translation: a total geek.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Only to see.
I think she broke the skin.
George bit you?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Hey, did you get contacts?
Why would they exaggerate?
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
I've been here. What day is it?
He's been here all night?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Peter knows something.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Are you following me?
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
It's stupid.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Was there anything in that washer?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Everything okay?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
You at least owe me the truth.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
It's for you. Frida.
How the hell is that your business?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What kind of animal?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
Just visiting my patient.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Lost something?
I don't know who they are.
What now?
What is that door?
I didn't realise...
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
I'm nothing then.
It's a trick.
What happened to you?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
No more than the usual.
How much do you usually get paid?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
A month.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
What do you think you're doing?!
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
I'm going to kill him.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I don't think so
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
No.
I'm afraid so.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Why?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Something like what...
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
What?
Yeah.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You mean with you and everything?
Oh... Yeah.
You're leaving?
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Hi.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
We're all set,  sir.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Ain't no place safe.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
You are dying, too.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
TONY....TONY....
NOOOOOOOOO!
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
You fired that shot, didn't you?
It's been fired.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
What is the point?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Well, sure!
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Dead Poets honor.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Again!  Louder!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
You really think I should forget her?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Found what?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Todd, what's the matter?
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
No thanks.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
What other bunch?
I'm not a thief.
What are you people talking about?
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
Anti social?
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
The "come back" kind.
What is it?
Yeah...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
It's okay...come on...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
A little to the left...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
What is it man?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
She fucked me too.
Nick's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
I got delayed. I --
Married?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
You're back.
I came to see Merle.
Everybody love Linda.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Biederman, yes.
Linda, Linda...!
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Frost.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
I want to go home, Merle.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
You should have put that on last night.
Nick, he just came back.
Pow.
Pow?
Merle --
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
More bullets in the gun?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
How's Linda?
I like it, Nick.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Sal, we need you. We need you.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up a little there... What would you say?
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Mug sheets.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Remember my promise.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I got it.  I got it.
You my partner?
Yes.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
They're going to rob that bank.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Yeah.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
What's this?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
You all right?
What's your name?
Let's dance together -- Belle.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
Belle --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
Guess there will, if it says so.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Anybody can see that.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Loan shark -- hey?
What Grange?
Where's everybody?
You are afraid!
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Jabez -- help!
He's stubborn as a Stone.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
What's that?
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
No, sir.
John.
Ellis, what have you told them?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
The code key, please...?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Roy?  You still with us?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Yeah?  What's the odds?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Roy?
Bullshit.
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Jesus, you're the man!
They're not after you, they're after me.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Would you do something for me? Please?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Yeah... yeah.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
What the fuck do you want?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Yeah ...
Hey... let him out!
What's the matter with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
Would I hire you?
You all right?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
It's up to you ladies.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Because I don't want cancer.
Dead or alive?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
They're trying to come through the door!
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Okay, when do I get them?
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
What's wrong?
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
You're news, Sonny ...
And if you can't deliver them?
This is Bishop.
Morning.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Did it hurt?
Hello?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
I don't know.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Cunt.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Hello?
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
I be.  I'm living large.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
No!
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Nice!
Sorry, comb got caught.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
WAKE UP!
ML?
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Do we now?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
You keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Shit!  I forgot.
What else?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
What?
To get my money.
Ya like him, huh?
Yeah.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I'm listening.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
You listening to me?
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
You did?
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Yeah...
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Exactly! A pirate!
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
What?
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
According to the map, we're just about at school.
What?
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
That's a cow, Harry.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Shut up!
I kinda screwed things up.
I don't think so.
You have beautiful eyes.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
A blimp.
It's okay. I want the rush.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Yes, what?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What?
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
And, take some more pictures.
You got the Extender?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
The evidence of what?
Are you going to kill her?
My Lord!
What does Leto say, Piter?
What's that you're saying?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
You know the ancient tongues?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Thank you.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I never thought of that.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Ah, so I pull the strings!
I am always on time.
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Bela, what happened?!
Should I call a doctor?
Bela, are you ready?
So why didn't you do it?
But maybe not.
Why are you here??
Don't you have any savings?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
You really think so?
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Isn't he?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
What?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But you used to say --
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
And PERFECT.  CUT!
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Are you a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
The marriage already ended.
I am.  How's your father?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
The sun.
Huh?!
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
I'm really sorry...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
You don't wanna be noticed?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
You're sure this is gonna work?
You're <u>sure</u>???
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
At what point?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
I don't think so.
Yes?
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
She had white shoes.
Why? How...
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
I can't?
Our what?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
You do though, you look great.
What do you want?!
Ha!
Oh my God.
Well, when you put it that way.
Go!
Oh God, this is so weird.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
... yeah, then, but...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Are you all right?
It's not their fault.
Kinda'.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
You're in show business?
I got your message. Way to go!
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
You don't recognize me.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Tu
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
In love?
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
What?
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Looks good to me.
Sure
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Where to?
Doing what?
I want you to do something for me.
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
And how did you get in the school?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Still clear?
Three twenty-five.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Where 're you going?
I don't care.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Who put you up to this?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Now could you leave me alone?
How's the left these days?
Till 19-fucking-70.
Merry Christmas.
Yes.  But do you know?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
This business, Captain?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
They're yours.  Take them.
Will you work for me?
How what, Wendell?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Bud...
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
No.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
I got her address.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
What do you mean?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
Dudley, we've been over this.
Why?
Ed, I want confessions.
Something like that.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
What about you?
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
She is Lana Turner.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
What's her name?
Not good enough.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
On what evidence?
Do you have any proof?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Where'd you hear that?
Shut up!
What's wrong, Trash?
And no one'll know about this?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I don't know who he is.
Told by whom?
You're crazy.
I don't know what that means.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
Get dressed. We're leaving.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Yeah.
Who?
Drive.
What if--
Reynolds.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Who's calling?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
What are you saying?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'll say.
Eight.  Size eight.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Your stuff?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Who did you work with to get the--
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I see her for business.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
My suitcase--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
And then what?
Other than me.
Thank you.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
We're screwed.
It's not me?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We believe he did.
We'd rather not--
Your shoe.
Seat 74.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Robert--
He's kidding.
Do I know you?
Can I talk to you a second?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Rachel's dead?
I don't know!
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
Yes. But we can't.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It means who's side are you on?
We found the originals.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
So they know everything.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I don't care to bargain.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Will you please come in?
Now.
What else?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Don't talk.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Why do they care about our maps?
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Is this you?
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
So was my Patient.
So you can shoot a pistol?
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Thought you'd never wake up!
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Why?  Is he staying?
Arguing about books.
Hey! -
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
What do I do?
Why would anyone do this?
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
Hello miss.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
He's sleeping.
Go away.
What about your rank or serial number?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
That's doable.
I don't know, but close.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
I have a question...
Uh. I'm showing off.
Mr. MacDougal.
Uh, yes.
Seems I am.
I'll call an ambulance.
You disappeared.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
So what?
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Only a week?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Did I hear a car?
So how long to pop the floor?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
To us. To the Mask.
Aren't we all.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Hmmm...44 long.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Which is--
Oh, it is.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
This is just show and tell.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
What the hell is this doing here?
Yeah.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Oh, yeah?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
What kind of things come up?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Why good?
She insulted me!
Erin, it's just a meeting.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
When?  Where?
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Two million dollars?
Who's the judge?
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Whose number do you need?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Keep your voice down.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What's going on?  What are you doing?
Thinking.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What's going on?
There's something else, too.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
He'll learn.
Will he finish what he begins?
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
I can help them!
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks and growls at his boss.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... Like we're being watched.
Yeah ...
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
I have felt it.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Yes, Your Highness?
We?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
What is it?
How do I look?
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
It's a lovely outpost.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
Luke!
What?
The deflector shields are gone.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
You rest now.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Why not me?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Nobody's going to believe it.
What are they doing here?
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Cuervo...?
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
I see your point. What's the favor?
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Delgado?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
How do you know all this?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Good day to you, sir.
Move aside!
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
What book is that?
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
Very well. Climb up.
I will run.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
A lovestruck page!
They do.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
To kill and be king, is that all?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Thank you.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
How are you today?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
So, what causes this?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Chris MacNeil?
Please go away.
Pretty close?
I beg your pardon?
I didn't get you?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
I don't know
Yeah
What?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
How do you know?
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
I believe you.
You just missed them.
She seemed fine.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
I've seen it.
Another one. Had your lunch?
It would bring us together.
No.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
What's this about?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Is that a threat?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Is there someone inside you?
Is it Captain Howdy?
No.
You're not going to drive.
Little slow tonight.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
No bones?
Piano.
Accident?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Oh my God ...
Out.
That's not the point.
What's wrong with it?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
I hate your kids, Frank.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You look awful.
Really.  You sleeping?
I don't gotta go.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What are you, crazy?
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
It's not gonna hurt you.
See anything?
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Last?
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Okay.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
What the hell are you doing?
How's it coming?
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
What're you doing down here?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Be reasonable, Jack.
No.
Nothing. We get nothing.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
This is show business?
You're an hour and a half late.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
So run a little longer.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
What's the problem?
Changed?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Save it for your wife.
They're tight.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Hey, we're connected.
Hey, will you look at that?
Huh?
Got another song for us?
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
Born and bred.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
All right.  Hold on.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
The Stratford.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Guess I got a little scattered.
You were good.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Yeah... No.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah.
So how's the cat food business?
What kind?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
What's a prom?
Yeah?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
You mean if I get sick?
What did he do?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Why would he need more?
Hey, bro ...
A few blanks?  Like what?
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Who is this?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Jon, what is it?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
You killed them?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Stay away from my family!
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
When did you start smoking?
Get rid of them.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
You always say that -- then you leave.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Her assistant?
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Mr. Mintz.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Take you, for instance...
Jack, are you okay?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
She wants to have an affair with me.
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
C’mon Jack...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Me?
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
How much time?!
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
It’s lovely...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
Kate’s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
You mean this chocolate cake?
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Jack...can we afford all this?
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
A perk for what?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
No...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Damn...damn...damn...
No...I’m not...
Last night was great...
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
What is this?  Where's Reed?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
This is wrong in so many ways.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
And if he's not...?
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
<u>Ben</u> did this?
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Feeling better?
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Brain injury.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
What is it?  Anything wrong?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
What do you mean?
Doctor, what's wrong?
You left something out.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
About forty miles an hour.
I can't tell you.
Sort of.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
What?
Clear him off the road.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Three people. In Brainerd.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Uh-huh.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Uh-huh.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yeah, but -
Huh? Yah?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Jerry Lundegaard.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
...Dad?
Are you calling Stan?
Whatcha watchin' there?
Yah.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Well, they -
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Gotta go?
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah - how are you doon?
Geez! You look great!
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Well, they're a good outfit.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
No, I didn't...
So?
Yah?
Margie Olmstead?
...Hello?
What'd he say?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Gustafson's accountant.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Whose car?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Thanks, hon.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
We're still men.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Does this sound strange to you?
The dynamite...
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
And I saw you practicing this...
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
I'll take the parasites.
How did you find me?
Really?
So you're staying in tonight?
Hear what?
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is that what you're calling it?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Tyler...
Who's this?
How have you been?
Yes... it's a test.
What?
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
There's always that.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
A hotel?
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Unbelievable, huh?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
I'm not asking you to.
What?
What are you talking about?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Stop finishing...
Please...
NO...
Why... why... why... ?
Why what?
... no, no, no...
Very good, Sir.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
There is no money.
You're welcome to join our club.
What are you doing?!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Yesssss...
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Yeah, how?
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Speed up.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
What?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
I tried calling last night but your father --
We have to tell her she's in danger!
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Remember the departure time?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Police are coming.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
"Next?"
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
It broke!
What are you doing?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Knock it off!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
No.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
American?
Roundeye.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You never been in one of those things.
Can you handle the door gun?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Typical...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
American.  Come to get you out.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Let's do it.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
What are you two up to?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
What's her name?
That's O.K.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Parry...
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
In a bar called Hellfire.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
You advise us!
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
It sounds exciting.
Well, it's enough for me.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Divorced.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
No.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
Well...
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
I didn't get it, did I?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Oh.
What?
Yeah, me, too...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
But what about me?
I guess you fell in the water.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Tomorrow, then.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
That's right.
I'm fine.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
I have to talk to you.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Catherine...
I hope I didn't hear that.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
What?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Victor.
I, umm, came to see you.
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
A play-ya.
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Pitt.
Which one?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
For real?
Yo! What you goin' for
You gonna talk to him?
Like this?
Yo, that's my girl.
Positive.
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Would you like me to change anything?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Hey, what are you doing?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
That's Babar.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax....
Just relax.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
You don't have a piece of the action?
What?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Cash. I'm impressed.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Has he?
He sighs.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Yo!
Can I steal you for a minute?
Shoot.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Did you say cops?
John Ultrarelamensky.
That's a strange combination.
I ordered lunch.
Lunch...
Yeah.
So?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What's wrong, Gail?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
I recommend it.
Your call is come through.
The door was unlocked.
What?
This morning.
Uh, almost.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Not really.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
No, I ain't got you...
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Contacts.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
I came to warn you...
You gave it to the girls for one.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
What are you running from?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Polo.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
How nice.
So...
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
How's everything?
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
What?
Who knows?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I wasn't looking.
Who's this --
I'm going to put them on the cat.
What's your story?
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
You want some eggs.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Yeah.
Timezit?
Same car.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
What I know is what I told you.
Switches are shorted out.
You give him his drops?
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Frank, we need to talk...
I think you know, Frank.
What do you mean?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Deleon.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Fire.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Are you alright"?
October 22, 1969.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
What do I tell them?
Got it.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
John, you still there?
It's not your fault, Dad.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
Please, Dad, just do it.
I got it.
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
You work too hard, John.
She's pretty special.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
Who the fuck is this?
Sullivan?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
No more... I can't!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
What's the matter?!
Which one is it?
What are they saying?
A hammock?
I don't know.
Faster!  Eat faster!
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Ahh, nothing.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Daddy, what is going on?
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
So what are ya drawin'?
Boy scouting.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Eight times.
The what?
No, I --
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
What are you doing?
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Oh my God, Steven.
Well?
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
Have you seen Tamara?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
I guess not.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
This is Jason's fault!
What are you doing in here?
You have no right...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
I demand to know what is going on...
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
You're telling a lie.
I...I can't...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Yes...
Hi, Sean.
I didn't mean for you to go!
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Don't talk like that.
It's just a review.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
I'm not ready.
We're making too much of this.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
What?
It's your best play, Nicky.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I'll have whatever she's having.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
Joanne Bourne.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
This could be it!
What do you want?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
They're only gonna lose.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Because God loves a winner.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Why does it matter?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
What?
Alla puttanesca.
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Is it true?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I haven't come to you.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
God gave you ten thumbs.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
A -- a week.
It was one incident.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
A great deal.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
I would rather march.
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Have you read his magazine?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
A man's dead, Detective.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
Don't underestimate these imposters.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
German.
What about this?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
What makes them think that?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Not bad, Jerome.
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
Yeah.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Why not?
Why don't we say we were together?
We were just looking.
They found an eyelash.
In the South Wing.
My medication.  I left it back there.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
There's a problem, Lamar.
And you got him...
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
For exits off Main Street.
They checked in.
Do you trust him?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
I can handle it.
When we had trouble before it was different.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
How much?
I want to say something.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
So what?
Where do we go from here?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Let's just get to the border.
You serious?
You got it.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
How?
Who?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Yes.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
Why?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Yes.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Really?
Could you do me a favour?
Brumby.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
You sure about that?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Now just a minute...
What about Keith?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
No chance of that.
Is he?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Yeah.
Mmm...
You did?
They did.
...this shit...
It's not.
No.
Yes.
With River Oaks?
No.
You...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
How?
Yes.
You haven't talked to him.
Well.  Well...
You didn't?
What did you say?
You're actually talking about this?
Yes.
What will he pay?
A job with Graff.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Oh, yes, George.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Are you sure?
I didn't ask to be.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
And why is that?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
No, who?
You think so?
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
I don't want to go to lunch.
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Mmm.
...did they...
Shelly...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
You know what those leads cost?
Yes.
Not lately you can't...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Why?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Well, hadn't it?
No.  It hadn't.
I don't know what you are saying.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Shit.
They took the phones...
Fuck you care...?
"Always be closing..."
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Oh!  For the magazine...
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Did I...?
Yes.
What do I...?
I don't understand.
I'm not.
We're going to speak to her.
No.  She told me "right now."
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
And the check is...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Where are you going?
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
Why do you have to go?
 What?  You read it in the papers?
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
You're not my father!
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
No, Dad.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
No.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
What do you want me to do?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
I bet you can't guess what happened?
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
 And he agreed?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
Go on, tell me.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
Fifteen percent skim?
We've never sent this much with one courier.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
This committee owes an apology!
Whose orders are these?
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
However I can help you...
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
So?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I do not.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I thought we would meet alone.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Turnbull is a good man.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
What about Michael Corleone?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Just thinking out loud.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Fuck you.
This looks corny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Just that I was in the Marines.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You don't say?  Which picture?
It's new.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Is this David's doing?
Did you kill anyone?
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
What way might that be?
So we understand each other?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
No.  The girl.
Is that really her?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
But you said --
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
I don't know.
Just take off the fucking mask!
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Hey, Boone.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
How are you?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
How's the leg?
A boost. A big boost ...
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Yeah -- ?
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
What's this -- ?
I guess ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
You guys have any skills at all?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
We'll take it...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
Sure -
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
You okay -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
So what are you gonna do?
What happened to you?
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Hey, now -
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
You boost her -- ?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What for -- ?
That's what I want ...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
This time it's for real?
Okay, then... Otto?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
How old are you now, Toby?
Who's "Eleanor?"
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
You know what you got here?
Not really -
Why don't you leave him alone?
Billy, how are you?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
It'll be okay.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Then you're safer in here.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
You know. The stuff I left.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
I gotta talk to you.
Don't worry about it.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Nah.
Yeah.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
I hate to do dishes.
Are you okay? What happened?
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
How's the woman?
Gone.
What?
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You don't know that.
No, I had to talk him down.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
WILL!
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
Some other guy?
I'm not sure--
Will you take a check?
Good, it was all right.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
No.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Yes.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Why me?
My kind of background?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Jobs doing what?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
What is?
Watch your mouth.
No.
So Christ, call her up.
No, I don't.
Yeah.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
I didn't want the job.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Oh, I know.
I know.
Yeah, I think so.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I kind of got that impression.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I swear to God.
Where have you been?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
It's important that I learn this.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Like me?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
How do you know that?
Is that what you think--
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Any gas?
Gallon or two?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
I guess that's what he looked like.
So long.
Deputy sheriffs.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Crate fell on me.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Yeah. On my way home now.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Is it fur?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
You're right!
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Naw--not much!
Yeah.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
Got any plants?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Anybody ask anything?
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Mad, Ma?
Look, Ma!
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Got any more, Ma?
They killed Casy first.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Which ones?
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Morning.
Yes I do.
--No.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Bad people.
Bad television.
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
No.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You don't understand...
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Yes.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
No.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
He didn't.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Never enough.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
You have a headache?
Of course you will.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
He sells BMW's?
It didn't work out.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You sleeping all right in that house?
I have a way with animals.
He's beautiful.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Why didn't it work out?
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
How long is this going to go on?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Did he mention it?
I'll take care of it.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
When? Tonight?
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Let's bring your bags inside.
So do you.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
You've got to stop doing that?
What was I saying?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
I was there for that shot, actually.
You don't seem to upset?
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Isn't it like, obvious?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No!
We still have a way to go.
How long were you married?
Well, that'll happen.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Ta-da!
Snoop onto them...
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Who's that?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Here's your class.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
What the hell are you doing?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Name your stakes.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know, I know who wrote it.
You would have looked better.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
This morning.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Are you two okay?
Michael Myers.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
I've got you come on, go down.
Then we'll be safe?
You don't believe that do you?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Do you?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Why?
Its true, Sheriff.
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
I wasn't spooked.
I don't know.
Will you call me tomorrow?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Anybody live here?
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Sure...
Where?
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Sure.
I don't like that story.
What about the rest of my comic books?
I saw him...
I'm scared!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
I've given them his profile.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
You want to see some?
We're a big hit.
Right.
Well, I live downtown.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
You're joking.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
Hmm?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
And it ruins everything else.
We could...we could do that.
Mm-hm.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yes, but you name names.
Hi.
I'm...all right.
No, I don't think so.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, sure.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Page a hundred and twelve.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Isn't that beautiful?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I almost didn't.
And you're in love overnight?
Aren't they great?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Mm-hm.
Me?
...or films you must see or... 
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Why?
Because I have to!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
No.
Oh...
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Hi!  Hi!
Yeah?
That's really nice!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
It's, uh, you never know--
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Ohh!
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Boy--
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
You treat me like a loser.
Hey, what's the matter?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Can we, can we go?
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
Yeah.
Good.  How are you?
No, I am.  I am.
Hmm.
Really?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.
Okay.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Take our literature...
And?
...<u>please</u>...
It wasn't my day.
...how are things at the Hospital?
I'm looking for...
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Then you tell me, then.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
...the whole world's out to get you...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
You take this much time over everything?
Where was the call from.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
The children...?
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
No, no, of course not.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
You seen John Brigham...?
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
I think its meaning is clear.
That could be.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Give it up, Evelda.
My husband brought it to me from America.
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
She my foster.
Yes.... yes...
Make them eat the figurine.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Give me your gun...
I don't understand.
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
...what did you want? 
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Thank you.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...why?
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Freeze!  You're busted!
Go stand by the flagpole.

Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Hey.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."

Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
So, are you a cheerleader?
All right.
Because you're an idiot.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Veronica, you look like hell.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
There are no stupid questions.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
S'okay....
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Did not.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
If you'll excuse me......
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Let's kick his ass.
You two....
You two....
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
I'm not hungry.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
gives her a sympathetic look.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
To be known as He!
Him.
You're such an incredible woman.
John has fallen in love with me!
Let's go overseas . . .
Just a couple more . . .
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I understand... I won't-
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
What?
Really? Do tell.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Who's Allison?
That was cold...
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
But... I thought...
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Are you ready?
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
How recently?
It's November.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Mister LaPlante...
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
I... I know that, John...
John, I know all about it.
"A little mistake"!
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Ticket!  What's going on?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
What?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You test each one thoroughly?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Was that your dad?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Right.
-- institution.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
I'm thirsty.
Did Daddy tease you?
Mommy!
Have you just plain asked him?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Here, take this out to the table.
Neil -- what --
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
No.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
I thought we'd be happy here.
He wasn't there.
Oh, honey.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
What for, dickweed?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
What is it?
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
You?
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Sing.
That is what bothers me.
Yes.
What worries you?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
This cannot be.
How comes it your are not afraid?
The past?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Yes.
You're twenty minutes late.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
So?
Would you like to see it?
What now?
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I like my work.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
My dreams died long ago.
No.  The money, please.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
You get anything on Smith?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
What do you want to do?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
You won't die if you let me help.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
There is no way out.
What are you talking about?
How about the cop?
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
Talley?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Okay.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Keeps to himself, more like.
Okey-doke.
Are you out of your mind?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
What do you want?
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
All right.  Now the second one.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
We can't carry him.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
What do you want?
I can't go without Thomas.
What's going on?
He didn't say.
Go.
Sounds like you know the job.
You want me to stick around, I could --
It's mine.  Talley.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
Are the disks still in your room?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
How many in your family?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
You know what the Scottish call it?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
He will be here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Your brother's here?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
The president has been murdered.
Any luck?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
What's the matter?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
We have to have a plan.
What's wrong?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
What are you doing?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
When?
What is this about no water?
Out? Where are you going?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- bullshit --
What are you playing here, Price?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
-- what was he doing here?
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Uhhhh...
I'll meet you down there.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Good point.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Asking the wrong person again.
-- and who's next on your list?
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
I was in the middle of --
I think...I may have the answer.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
-- it wasn't me.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Pritchett: what is going on?
We don't have proof of that.
Town records are coming up now.
A few years older, perhaps.
I don't understand.
What about all my other stuff?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Are we going back to California daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
No.
What is it?
Who?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Maura!
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
You must be the new tenants.
What was she afraid of?
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Thank you.
How long will it take!
Keep talking!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Hello?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
I'll boil some water.
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
I'm sorry.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Hmmmm.....
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
Welcome to Rome, sir.
How.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Oh, you read that.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Wha--
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Oh Hudson...
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
You certainly do.
Get away from there, convict!
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Sharp.
The Hudswinger!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Well, I --
...You know! For kids!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Oh, is that it!
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
I know that, Amy.
...Certain people are --
...The people look like ants.
What a beautiful thought.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
This I know, Benny.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
But, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
...Who let you in?
Well, I'm a college graduate --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
There's one in every story.
...No money.
Maybe he's wise.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
Thank you for waking me.
Where?
Alive?
You don't believe in it?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Mrs. Rand...
Is this disease common in the tropics?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
But it's so far away...
Yes -- on the boat.
Is she a doctor?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I wish I hadn't heard --
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
An accident at the mill?
Investigation of what?
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
Benjie!
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
No thank you. We should be off.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
So early?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
What?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
What do you mean?
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
You've...
I'll drive you --
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Here.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Your toes cold?
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
What?
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
I don't like coffee.
It's not a bother.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
How'd you know?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Want some gum?
Sure.  Twinkie?
I don't ever want to see you.
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
And?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Vodka?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I have to get back.
Duggar called him?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Are you sure about that?
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
That's not what he thinks.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
Hey...
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Down at the station?
No.
You gave her gifts.
Where's your back-up?
What are we?
That is a picture, nothing more.
Your lover.
And yet you knew what I would o.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Not you my dear.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Louis, put me in my coffin...
You want me to be a doll forever?
You... fed on me?
You both did it?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
How do I look?
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
What have I done?
Dear God, what have I done?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
I can't.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
The girl, Lestat -
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
The story about stakes through the heart?
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
There's nothing between Will and me.
No.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
No way.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I don't know...
Yeah.
I understand something.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Never do that again.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
I don't know.
This was not my idea.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Hello?
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
You guys lost?
They were cut loose.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Goodbye.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
She has never mentioned her family.
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
What would I be thinking?
That your father and I ——
You wouldn't tell that ——
Woman, what are you doing here?
Yes?
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Oh, now —— now look here ——
It makes me fear her.
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
Daughter -- my daughter --
Well, tell, him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
All right –– all right.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
By letting me help you.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
She's . . .
Sit down? What are . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
What's that?
Hiya, George!
Of course it's the place.
Well?
Today, over at the house.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
What?
No charge.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Came back three days ago.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Oh . . .
How's that?
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
When?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
I'd like to do that.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
What'd you wish, George?
If I told you it might not come true.
Have you made up your mind?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Is it snowing?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I've eaten.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Huh?
What?
How fast is enough?
Maybe by now they are.
Yeah.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
That's awful.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
The lighthouse?
What is it?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Want to talk about it?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Good morning!
On your own time?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Mike's out there.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
What else is there to do?
I'm going.
Pop....
I kind of had plans....
Too late, it's written.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
The what?
The Shark's mouth.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Okay, so that's it.
What makes you think there might be?
Mmmm.
It's good with coffee.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
All summer?
I know what you're going to say.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
I know, I know....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Someone has to do something.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Is that me?
How old is your cousin?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Be careful....
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
You're going out.
So?  So?
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Yeah.
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
You called, Doctor?
How come?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
It's his work.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
What's wrong?
Michael, the sub's dead.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Kathryn...
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
No,  I'm not going through there.
So tell Calvin.
Honey, what is it?
Me.
Are you okay?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
I can have them walk backwards.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
How's sleeping beauty?
A piece of pie on Sunday.
Give me a ride?
... Massachussettans aren't.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
I don't know, what else is there?
Now what's this do?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
How far away is filter number four?
What kind of trouble?
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Look great, don't I?
I want to see Kathryn.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
That bugger moves fast.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Come on, sweetheart....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
We need milk....
How come it's my responsibility?
What the hell are we arguing about?
Off....
Sweetheart....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Michael!  This thing working?
No, no...It's too dangerous....
I almost forgot....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
I'll be all right, Michael.
I'm not going to quit now....
You just got here....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
I'm fine.
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Won't you get in trouble...?
Hurry!
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
I stuck them on, man....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Hey!
Put me down....
Bad boy....
Money is money....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I don't like it....
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
You don't like my voice...?
I've got to get to her....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
That bad, huh?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
How'd you do it, old man?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
I haven't got it.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
You believe me, don't you?
Why's she blind, Bro?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Three or four.
Once.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Is this normal?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Yes, Sir.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
You must have some idea about him.
No.
Did Amber have a dog?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
You said, you were in the bad lands?
How d'you know what I'm like?
He said that? What else did he say?
You know? How do you know?
Has he got your aunt's address?
Is that Margie?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
I have to finish my job --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
There is something missing here.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
I see what you're saying.
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
No no. I knew.
You think so?
Wonder what he said.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
I don't need you to "stick."
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Oh, thank you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I'll give it everything.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Another drink please.
--  the kwan.
Great word.  Towel?
Forget it.  Forget it.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
You don't want to go home, do you?
No, you're --
Why not --
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
Funny.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Shut up!!!
Do you think it goes all the way across?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Young adult.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
We should try fishing again.
You mean it?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
I CAN GET HIM!
I try not to.
Good luck with the fund raising.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
In Costa Rica?
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
What did you think?
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
Why?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Any damage?
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
I don't believe you.
I'm not going, John.
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Is that kid still bothering you?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What?
Where's the power and radio setup?
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
Phones are out too.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How many lines of code are there?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
They are?  I'll be damned.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
Carousel.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
They died together?
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Not just every six weeks.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
It's all right.
Alan, listen to this.
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Straight-A brainiac!
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You got me.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Machines hate you?
You want to talk about this?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
You're sure?!
Oh my God!
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Ah - - they're here.
Dad - - Dad - -
I like cows.
Watch how it eats!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
What works?
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Don't do that!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
That's not true...
I don't know...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Two.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
None of that's true?
Insomnolesence...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
How do we prove it?
How long will he need to be asleep?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
See this?
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Fine -- terrible.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
Just what you've published.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
Did you see him?
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
I usually take lunch by the River.
Well, I --
I suspected that he -- well.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Tonight?
And you ...?
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
I've heard of it happening.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
That's <u>mad</u>.
You look tired.
Oskar!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
I want to thank you.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Give it back!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
She was with you after she left Frank.
-- May I? It's so --
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Yes.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
-- Tuscarora --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Well --
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Mm.
Bree --
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
With Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Mm.
You're going back?
You wanted to, or you are?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
Yeah.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Well --
Two years ago? Sorry.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
Uh, huh...
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Salisbury steak.
Then eat around it.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Eight, almost nine years.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
A heavy drinker?
How long was that?
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
You have?
Ted, do you love him?
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
What?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
I know....I know.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
I'll take my chances.
How many?
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You ever think about getting married again?
Ted, I just heard...
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Can I do anything I want?
Where will you keep them?
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
I will not approve it.
General Chiang.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
This many?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
America, we shall see.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
We have enemies.
This is Britain.
Tell me.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
I haven't broken any laws.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Mr. Cyr!
Around here.  Yeah.
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Where is he?
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
Excuse me?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
And how would we neutralize him?
He's gonna live?
Oh my God.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
In Maine?
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
You okay?  Kelly?
Like little children.  You okay?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Did he say anything?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
And this is how he came to the boat?
What?
What?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
What was that?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But if he knew we have so little time -
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Your bleeding has stopped.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
They all were.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Early. Still dark.
Yes. I'll tell you.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
I'm sorry.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
I see...
How far is it, scout?
No.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Got a reason to stay.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Excuse me. What did you say?
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Their arms?
The honors of war?
You mind if I take a look at this?
Doc eat already?
I thought they were your friends?
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Excuse me, sir...
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Not yet.
Bullshit.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Getting some food.
Look.  Water.
How far away is she?
The infirmary?...
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What is it?
Are you sure you saw something?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
How much did you part with?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
Like antiques.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Can I help?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
All right, Dad.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
Who was that?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
And the weed?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
You will what?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
So?
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Six.
Er, fertilizer.
So?
Leave your sister out of it.
I can't take any more school.
That makes it okay?
I can fix cars.
No, sir--
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Just wondering.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You little pissant--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
I never met her.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
So they stayed in Florida?
Dad--?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Hey, Mikey--
Mikey look at this--
Yeah?
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Is very beautiful, your car.
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
We don't need a new jail.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Charley Wade.
Do you?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
There was a mandate in the last election--
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I never said that.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
And when my father was Sheriff?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
You gonna stay out here?
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
They've got my Amado.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
How come it feels the same?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
The Republicans?
You'd do a good job.
How 'bout you?
You think we need a new jail?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Name's Otis.
I know that.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Hokey enough for you?
You did.  Didn't you?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Please.
Did your husband know Quaid?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
I don't know where you'd start.
Oh Christ.
No.
And they all came...
Oh God!
You can't.
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Don't look.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
--vanished.
Are you finished with me?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Go away.
Whose is the car?
You know of him?
I like to know why things happen.
Yeah, I know.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
D'Amour --
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Hold on.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
For an introduction.
Are they all in the business?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Didn't know you read minds.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
You didn't try hard enough.
Yes?
I don't know.
What?
Maybe... I... don't...
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
I'm thinking about it.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Oh, hi.
I don't want to go home.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
But, I'm mean.
No one ever tells you that...
You are.
You made it.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Charlotte?
Do you like massage?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Not all that pasta.
Tomorrow.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
No, what are you talking about.
Will you please stop smoking?
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Hmmm.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Something he said, just before...
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
What do you mean?
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
You okay?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What are these?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
I know who he is.
It's useless...look at him.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
What's this?
Thanks again for everything.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You're a caterer?
Coach...
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Careful.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
So how long is this trip?
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Oh, great.
Too many times.
I know.  But chances are...
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
So how about a little one-on-one?
Clothes.
You're not stupid.
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Quincy...
Hey.
We're going to get some food.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Least she had time for me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You forgot to be there.
Never had to.
What?
Just something I'm trying.
What are the doctors saying?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Maybe go back to school.
I heard enough.
Then why are you so upset?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
No.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
At one in the morning?
Nona, please.
Okay.
Said he'd be home later.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Just...leave it alone.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
You know, people.
Tell me what?
I ain't a damn liar.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Came by to check on you.
You want me to fuck off?
What surery?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Does this sound weird?
It's a helluva disease.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
baby, please, please --
uh...uh...What is it?
For what?
You don't have a boyfriend?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Really?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
So you've done it --
Why not?
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry --
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
What?
Yes.
-- what kind?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Sorry, little man.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
Doc it's Janet.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
What?  What does that mean?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
You mind your own bussines.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
No.
Twelve.
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Is this 509-9027?
I would just want to clear some things up:
This isn't meant --
And what did your parents do?
She's retired.
Do you have your masters?
It's not your given name, right?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
It's interesting.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
There's no disturbance.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
I'm a bad person.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
Yes.
How long with Paula?
Do you have any children with anyone?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
But you can't say....
I don't know what I've done.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Are you on drugs right now?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
You need to sober up.
Bottled Water?
Ok.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
..sorry...
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
Mother -- ?
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Your Majesty...
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
A body.
Those can be adopted --
Three days.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
So what has changed?
And why are you so glum?
No, not Louis!
We go someplace dangerous.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
Die?  What...?
D'Artagnan!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I know.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Recent hours have been a shock.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
A personal nature?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Get out of my way.
Forgive?!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
... Two-thirty-seven.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Shall I leave?
You mind if I ride with you?
You set to go -
Did you hit him?
Find out for me.
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Mind if I turn out the light?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
No, but I'm listening.
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Yeah.
And?...
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Don't you guys ever knock?
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
What's the bottom line?
Could he handle a direct contact?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
In thirty-five minutes.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
You said the guy down here is good.
What do you want to do?
What's one way?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There has to be.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Yes, are you okay...?!
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
No. Reba...?
You'll come by?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
God, no.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
I want to see Lecktor now.
She'll be in, in the morning...
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
No. I can help you.
He's very strong physically.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
Hello, hotshot!
Me, too. And very erotic...
Blue is cold.
No.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
What's this Mama shit?
Will?  You could come up here.
You going back down to Florida after?
What's that?
Yeah...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
And?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Do you dream much, Will?
I want your opinion.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
We were just trying to push the envelope --
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Have you told your family?
Hey Andy, good show.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
That was a really hot house!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
What's in Memphis?
A -- a tourist.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
What?!
You're two hours late.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
... yes.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Dead.  All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
I need an exit!  Fast!
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Are they any agent?
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
What do you know?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
What are you doing?
For what?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
How is he?
Got it.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Gee-zus.
What is this thing?
What does that mean?
What happened?  What did you see?
No, you... have to be.
What?
It's a city?
What are you talking about?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Operator.
It's locked.
Operator.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
That means it's good.
No, all we got is $40.
Uh...can we give you a check?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Get out of here before this really goes up.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
You got some mouth!
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Back so soon.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Hey, shut up.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
I know.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Maybe, who knows.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
I'm sleepy.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Just keep him quiet.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
That's your name?
Dinner?  Again?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
But what?
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
I thought you were buying my company.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
...See you tomorrow night.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Hot or cold.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
'Yes' to the deal?
Me, too.
Is there any more to it?
I am now.
'Just kidding'?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
My Doctor Lady?
She knows how she feel.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Very well, I'll watch.
And I'll be a visitor.
She's in a great deal of pain.
You first.
Almost.
I love your smell.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I don't know who you are.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Where are you going?
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
I like you in a black tie.
Susan --
I won't.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.
Joe --?
What do you mean?
No.
Are you going to eat your lunch
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
Hello, Bill.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I'm sorry, Bill --
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Are you threatening me?
An offense --
You want me to be your guide --?
What question?
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
How're you doing--?
How's that, Quince?
Next week?
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
21.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
You don't know?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Where'd you get it?
I don't want blood on them.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Take the money and walk away!
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Don't remember.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
What happened?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
What's wrong?
Help me.
Calm down.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
My wife.
You're the memory guy?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Shut your mouth!
This is your car.
Natalie? Natalie who?
Who the fuck are you?
How'd you know I was in here?
You're not coming?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
You probably.							 *
What was it for?							   *
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
And...?
He any good?
Tell them what you want.
You need to consider a few issues.
I don't know.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
How many?
Okay.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
That's right.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
...in the morning.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Like...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Hey, fuck him.
Go ahead.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Okay.  What's up?
From whom...?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Yeah.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Okay...see you soon.
Equipment?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
The Statue of Liberty.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
For money.
Oh hell, forget it.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Where'd that come from?
I'm scared.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Gin's okay.
What?
Listen, I gotta have money.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Yessir, I can see that.
Gonna be like money from home.
The kids? Why are they...
Years?
It's there!
How's your hernia?
Who?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Dad...I'm...
How far?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
I'll pay extra
...are you with the Consulate?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Hello, Billy.
And?
What do you mean?
Where is it?
What?
Hishradyo.
Just got some news on Bell.
What?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
H-how do I get...?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
I only got...
Can we get this car there?
He didn't do it!
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
Please.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Don't.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
Peter-
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
My God.
What do you want to know?
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Will I be able to walk?
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
If you wouldn't mind.
Nothing.
I can take it, go ahead.
Then the roads are open...
My daughter must be going nuts.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
The Sistine Chapel?
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
It'll only take a second.
--not fair?
You can--you have the "gotta"--
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
No, I haven't.
Don't talk to me like that.
Maybe.
Yes, Paul.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Yes.
You think he might be missing?
Hey, Pete.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
How grateful?
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Your room.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
I knew where it was.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Range is two kay.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
- this is very disconerting..
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Listen to what?
Ethan Hunt.
Awfully short notice..
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Before you are.
Just like old times.
Where do I meet you?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
How do you suggest I go about it?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
You have Bellerophon.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Donít Jim.
Always.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Talking's good, walking's better.
What happened to Jim?
Where were you?
Who is "they?"
What happened?
Two cars.  Where are you?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Yes.
Yes.  I see your point.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
This whole operation was a molehunt.
That depends.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Tell you what?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
He's our guy.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You got it.
Jim, itís over.
That's what we do isn't it?
Thirty-two and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Have I been a good wife?
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
He did?
Yeah.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
What'd you do to your hair?
Maybe I should come back another time.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I don't know.
Your blood.
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
What?
Why not?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah.
No thanks.
What do you want to do now?
You're late!
This is where we're going!
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
Yeah.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Will you marry me?
What do you mean?
On the floor?
Seven-thirty.
Who is he?
WHAT?
Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
A wife knows.
Oh.
We just come from the bank.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Where is she?
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
That's incredible.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
I'm sure she did.
May I presume to ask you a question?
That woman was a student of yours?
Yes.
Nerves.
May I walk with you a ways?
Temperature's dropping.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
You got me.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Yes!
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Am I right?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
What is that?
What, "is"?
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Course I have.
Look!
Are you sure he's got one?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
They're nervous, sire.
By what name are you known?
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Be quiet!
Shut up!
Exactly.  So... logically ...
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your name?
Here's one!
Don't be such a baby.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
We must examine you.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Back to your bed!  At once!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
The good-looking one.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
And she sent no word down?
She'll get over it.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
I hope to go up next year.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Gesture?
And that is my last word on the matter.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Do you hunt?
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
They don't see it.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Those, over there, there.
That doesn't make him an expert.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
John?
I was told you were in a fight.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
We're going to lose.
Yes.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Why was I not informed?
A few days, ma'am.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Your Majesty --
There is one other matter.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
So where is he?
Nick...
Because I didn't know where else to go.
We can't...
Where do we go?
What are you looking for?
Yes I am...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I know.
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
So what's the problem?
Beautiful night.
Yeah.
No problem. What's on your mind?
What did I say?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
No, I don't.
Right. See ya.
That's okay.
Yes.
Hi.
I think I've been hurt.
No.... I don't...
There's nothing?
I don't think...
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
You're so easy.
Oh boy.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Where at?
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
I'm working on it.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
What's the trick here ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
This is cute.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Do you know where you're going ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yeah a real shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
What's next Walt ?
An elevator ?
It's fine thanks.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Don't.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Fire the whole division.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Sir ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
What was that ?
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Thank you.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
What ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Don't mention it.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Totally groovy huh?
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
She just had a baby that's all.
Never heard of him. 
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well...
I know that.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Getting off please.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Vada.
WHAT??
What if you don't wanna be found?
You would.
Boy, you're really into this.
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
It's dangerous!!
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
For the mini-bike fund.
Wow!
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Do you know him?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Keep your voice down!
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
I wrote that.
Oh, how do you mean?
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
How's it going chef?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Are they ready yet?
Yes..
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Why?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
For this class?
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Do you like her?
Shut your big fat mouth!
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Can we look around in your camper?
I would.
Uh huh.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Are you going out somewhere?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Where's Daddy?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Oh no!  UUH.
Hurry!
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Don't DO that!!
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
Bed wetter!
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Got it!
I wanna live with them too.
Why are you running away?
It is not.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
I can see why.
You like her.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
The man you love.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
I suppose it's too late to start over.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Can you watch the road?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
About Michael's job.
So... one almost has to...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
I saw the show.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
I'm up against a deadline.
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
... yeah, that.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Why would she come here...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
You bet.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
His Word.
Who the hell is he?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Did you see who that was?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
You know anything about the stations here?
You must really like him.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
You got a place to stay?
No.
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
What year?
Fungus?
And before?
Do you ever do any writing?
Yes. Who's this?
Hello.
I have to go.
When did you think it would happen?
Older.
That's unkind.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Hello.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
Where's Bill?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Oh --
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Oh, why thank you.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Which do you recommend?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Say something.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
That's indescribable.
On average forty million.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Hypnotizing.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
Wayne---
Roger?
What's the travelling arrangements?
Who?
What the hell happened to you?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Rollin'...and speed!
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Two guys?
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Out.
It sure is.
Fill her up?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Where was your father born?
That's two bucks, Joe.
You working?
You work around town?
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
No thanks.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
How d'you mean?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Let's go, Duff.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Are you married?
I can see why.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Don't call them that.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I keep thinking about him.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Duff, I love you.
What 'you signifyin'?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Who're you?
How about a drink?
How you doin', boy?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Come on, Pop.
So I been told.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
Let's go.
Omar--
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Since when?
No. I only needed the code from you.
Take this off.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
What are you talking about?
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
The access code to your mainframe.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
You haven't got it?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
I thought you already left.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Couple of months.
A regular Fagan.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Something exotic I hope.
I know.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
How long will they watch us for?
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Right. 7:30.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
No Roger from op/ed?
You're Pam?
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Have you been there?
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Hey there.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Better person than I.
Wow. This must be big.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Yes, desperately.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
And a gymnast!
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Dorothy Parker--
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
I know.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Into our group.
Josie, you look Rufus.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Why not?
Can't you make other creations?
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
What about it?
You two got a thing going, or what?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You mean a shithead.
I figured you might like some help.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
Yeah?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Huh?
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
What?
Good morning, Jennifer.
Girl, what are you doing?
I gotta stay up, Max.
Jennifer --
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Oh God.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
Try me.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
What did you think?
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
God, that's an enormous arse.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Really, no.
I forgot my bag.
Oh -- Okay.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Are you busy tonight?
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
That's fine.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
You've got to go.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
This is the place.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
With a goat playing a violin.
Excuse me?
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Sorry about that.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Working with Leonardo.
Blimey.  What's that?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Martin -- your customer.
Max.  This is Anna.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Which was?
What?
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
And she's in your house.
Bad news.
What book?
No, Miss Ratched...
Yes, that is correct.
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Get up, Billy.
Will you come with me, please.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Sorry to have bothered you.
What for?
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Good. Why don't you join us?
What's your name, buddy?
B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Marry who?
M-M-M-Mack?
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Ca-na-da...
There they are!
What?
Neither do I...
Did to me?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
Giving up?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What for?
Let me see your hand!
'Kay, place your bets.
Hit me!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Oh, what was that?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
You think it's funny, huh?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
What are they?
Yeah...
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Tha's your problem.
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Your grandmother?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Let's find a telephone.
I'm a liberal!
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Hi there...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
You said whatever it was you would understand.
To the foot doctor.
So?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
So.  You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
What?
Why are you doing this?
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
Is something the matter?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Very funny.
Just since yesterday.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
How about the other one?  His friend.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
No.
I don't know, Kate.
No.  He's never asked me.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
No...  I can just tell.
Now what do we do?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Only what?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Faith--
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Why?
What about Peter?...
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Yes.  He is.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Oh.
No, why?
Right.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
What?  You know him?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Thanks.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
I wish I knew.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
That's right... .
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Father Barry.
Terry...?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Which side are you with?
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Wham... .
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
And if you don't?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
You haven't finished your beer.
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Edie... Edie... ..
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Get away from me.
Well, it's over.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
About Edie?
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Good luck.
Mind your own business, Father.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Looking for me?
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
What do you mean?
You do?
All right.  Put it on heavy.
You love me then?
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
I will decide the conclusion.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Then it is some service you desire of us.
No. No! No!
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
You didn't visit him in prison.
Why not?
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Do we need him?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
You at least bring the gun?
Whatta you think?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Who was the friend?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
There a problem, Foley?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Bleeding on a country road.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Why not?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I can go to the bar.
You did?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
You're not dumb.
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Thanks for your help.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
The fish?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
There were others.
She did, huh.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Hi, Ray.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Got run over by a car.
It's beautiful.
You were talking in your sleep.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Out for the evening?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
You mean hiding them?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Sorry.
What facts are those?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank.  You?
I can't make it.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Sorry to trouble you.
How'd you get this?
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Maybe I blocked it out.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What are you doing here?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
Come back to me.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
I'll never give up.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Are you for real?
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
I'd love to.
I can't do that.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
It's Charlie!
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Quiet today?
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Who was that man?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What are you doing?
I remember that dress.
But accidents can happen.
What a great kite.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
What are you doing?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
What?
Is something wrong?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Who was that?
What are you talking about?
I'm not burying him here...
You want me to help?
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Do you really think so, Andy?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Why are you getting dressed?
Drew!
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Thanks for coming in.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Continue.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Your... lover?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Sure. It's fine.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Opera?
A regular all-American guy?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Rach.
Yes.
Answer the question, please.
What did you say?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Uh.... No. Not really.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
They're coming.
Entered our minds.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Just come with me!
Here. Make it easy on you.
You'd die for them?
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
How many bottles?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
What, switch what?
Hey.
S'matter?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Didn't bite.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
Let's just be sure.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
For your own fear.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Fry?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
What's her name, anyway?
Not a star-jumper.
Take it.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
I apologize.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Geiger counter?
But how long is a day?
No.
Hmph.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection!
Huh?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Gone.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
No cigar.
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
With one of them.
What about me?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
What is your proposal?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Youse so fucked up man.
Where's he from?
Taylor! Francis!
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Feel good?
Dawn! That was it!
...don't feel like it either.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
No, thanks...
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Merle?
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Right...
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Okay. You win.
Bank?
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Want a spike in it?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Dance? Tonight?
They know you here--know your name.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
And Betty Mayfield--
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Me?
Please answer my question.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
We try to be decent.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
What does he see?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I can't answer that.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Name it.
Private eye?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Martini.
What's a buzzer?
What's this in favor of?
What?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How's life treating you?
In case you want to have us followed.
I don't.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You asked me where it all came from.
Did I do something wrong?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
You nasty, sardonic--
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
With what motive?
Recently, then.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Right.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Such as?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
No doubt about that one.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
So-so.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you she's just..
It's fine, thank you.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Yes.
How's Mary?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
I think it went on rather too long.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
To the Fleet.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Let me see.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Why not sit down and wait?
All right.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
No, thanks Dad.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
She said that?
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
What have you got there?
Promise?
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
And that's why you never went pro?
One shot stopping.
You gotta earn trust.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
That's the point, isn't it?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Aw shit.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
This Zen master surfer.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
This gonna take long?
Nice place.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
You saw what?
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
It's... it's not like that.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
No, you look like a hooker.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
That's ridiculous.
New York.
What motel you staying at?
For the whole night?
What?
Off the boulevard.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Mmm, I could tell.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Did you buy some clothes?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
And that's the way the game is played.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
What id we run into someone I know?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Vivian...
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Aw, don't... no...
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
What!?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
All this because of that whore!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Looks slow tonight.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I pray for that.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Want a pair of boots?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I'm just going to my room.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
But I always eat like this.
They will serve salad.
What?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Should I be?
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
... as ... you ... wish...
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
He's really very short on charm.
I don't think more than ten.
Have you any money?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Where did you get that?
What?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
You want me to read this or not?
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
No --
He's dead. He can't talk.
Slow going?
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
You're amazing!
Tell me.
Kill me quickly.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I accept.
You feeling any better?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
What are you saying?
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Yes, what?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Max, I...
Not.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Min Bialystock.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
I shall count the minutes.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
Hindenburg...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Vat?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You out to buy a motel?
The following morning. Sunday.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash.
And when she left, she never came back.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Let's all talk about Mary.
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
How much?
Five hundred.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
May I talk to you?
Lila.
Where?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
Where... can I stay?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
I feel better when you feel better.
Where's the old highway?
Probably on his way back right now.
Where could he have gone?
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
The bathroom.
You have something most girls never have.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
You're very... kind.
A man should have a hobby.
Why do you ask that?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Why don't you go away?
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Thank you, Norman.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Very early. Dawn.
Is anything wrong?
Mary is Lila's sister?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
I'll take you to...
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Was that all?
No mother.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
How do you do.
You here again?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What's that?
The wound is bleeding!
A voice ...
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I think so.
Thank you.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
What do you mean?
That's what I said.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
No kiddin'.
Fine, thanks.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Oh, is that what caused it?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Is that a fact?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
You're insane.
To lunch.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
What was her name?
Mia...?
Could you?
We flopped the first time out.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Buddy, you're just a child.
But Rose...
Here comes Daddy.
Yeah.
I got an awful toothache.
He did?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Okay.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Of course not!
Well, a little.
Yeah, he's still up there.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Open that door, damn you!
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
So am I.
Why is it taking so long?
How could that be, son?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Of course.
How goes it, darlin'?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
She does look a little peaky.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, sir.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Took your time gettin' here.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
You think it's that good?
What and?  That's what I got.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
What... ?
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Relax.
"A.D."
That's them trying to kill us.
What's the plan?
What?
Name one.
Bullshit.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
No, we're stealing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
You could start over again with cash like that.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
You know... you could say thank you.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
You get him?
Dead.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Why the beach?
You always did have style.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
There's still good in him.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
We're coming!
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Told you, did he?
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Oh. Well, yes.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
Yes.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Good God.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Wheeling
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
I think it's closed.
I don't think I belong here.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Paulie, please --
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You's the novelty, Champ!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
My side.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
No dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Gonna try.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
...Thanks.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
What?
Did you hear what I said?
What'd you say?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Makes your breath like garbage.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah --
Spider Rice.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Whatta' those?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
...The guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Help what?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Whatta you think?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
...People talk to me more.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
What's that comin' from the bar?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Does it hurt?
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
I didn't know who I could trust.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Yeah?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
No better?
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Every man betake him to his legs.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
I have.
If my heart's dear love--
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
By the hour of nine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
I will follow you.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
I don't know.
So where do you go from here?
Who the fuck are you?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Nobody's saying they don't.
Who are you?  IRA?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
We'll die if we stay here!
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Bullshit!
I swear...
Sent it where?
A means to an end, is that it?
That's it.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Gets the job done.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
You should watch what you eat.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Coordinate what?
He says this is their block.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
And what job is that?
You know him?
You sure your friend got the right place?
Very ugly.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
So I do it.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Finish the job...
You better get some sleep, alright?
You sure?
My man, how you doing?
Doing well.  This is?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know...
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
I don't know...
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
That's not what I mean.
And how do you figure we do that?
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Not bad enough to kill him.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
Well, I don't know...
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
Whoa, Earl!
Hi.
What's wrong?
He's not, he's...
You're worth every last penny.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
So do I.
A satellite dish?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Why?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Anything...specific?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
It was going to be a surprise!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
We're out of here.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
That's great Earl!
You think he skipped town?
This isn't right...
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
How much is that?
This is your ship?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
You bring American money?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
I knew you were lying.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Who?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
You pull a muscle or something?
She's getting undressed.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Well we're not friends.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
What is this?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
You know what a phone booth is?!
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
Beach Boy.
What?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Yes, I know this song.
I am from outa town.
Like that.
What are you doing here?
What a surprise!
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How about a lift home?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Nobody touches me.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What are you talking about?
Hello.
Han?
Yes.
I would like one of my people to help.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
What is he up to now?
Really?
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I already made an appointment for later today.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
And you defending her?
I think you'd look good in red.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
What?
No, no.  You're her best friend.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
No.
It was my mother's.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Right.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
A sense of humor.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Yes, I did.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Hi.
Which means --
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Is he home right now?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Window.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Will she scratch up your back?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Was Mom an adjustment?
God, she's beautiful.
What's wrong with Annie?
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
You're kidding --
You could have called me --
He's ten.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Who? A scab?
Are you sick, Mama?
They are singing for me.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
What makes you so sure?
Let them take it!
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Tell me.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
You mean you're ready to give up?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
But honey ...
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
What?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
First rate, ain't it?
Yeah.
Oh God.
This man sounds like a real catch.
What?
Go ahead.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
What is wrong with you?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
They would have killed you too.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Oh shit
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
My features. They're Finnish.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Sure, Jimmy.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Okay
What?
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
What?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
I was trying to score some dope.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
To who?
What?!
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Nervous?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Resistance?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Yep.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Shut up, will you?
I'd love to hear it.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Goddamn it, sir...
GO!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
How about...?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
And what about your own hand?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Don't do that again.
You set?  Sarge nods.
And Sarge?
Lingerie.
How can you, how can you say that?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
I'm gonna call her.
C'mon Lloyd.
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?
Wait a minute.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Oh yeah!
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I just had a phone call.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey, about what?
You think you know what this money is?
No, but you stole from them.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Well...
Would you hold this for me?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Thank-you.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
No, I'm serious.
You think so?
It's okay, everybody does that.
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're shaking.
It did?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
How can I look at you and say this?
It sounded like you did.
No I didn't.
You told your dad?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
YEAH!
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
My car.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Give me my firebird keys!
Later for you, Luke.
What?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
What's going on?
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Where are the guards?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
What are you doing?
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Pistols?
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
How's the name search going?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
Shit.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
I'm inquisitive.
WHAAAATT?
You could start with an apology.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
And much richer as a result.
Home--where he lives.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Go on, untie him.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
I never meant to imply...
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
And Joel's pre-med.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
This is all too familiar.
Let's go.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Where are you?
What do you want from me?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Where is your attacker?
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
Do you want to die?
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
What do you want?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Please, call me Gale.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Where are you Dewey?
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
They found another note?
You used to say that was our strength.
Always.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
You're not a detective.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
What's your point?
Who's phone?
Geez.
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
What'd he say?
Gale he's got Dewey!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
It's Sarah.
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
What are you doing here?
No...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
So...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Are you serious?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Yes.
Do I?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Hello.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Do you like scary movies?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Nah, I don't think so...
What do you want?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
What do you want?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I'm getting scared.
That all depends on you.
Now for the real question.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
And why is that? Has something happened?
You never know when or where a story will break.
What kind of lead?
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What about the cellular phone bill?
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
What's the plan?
How's the book?
I'm not here to fight.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Many times.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Why would she lie about it?
You're evil.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Can you knock?
No you didn't.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Stop. Right there.
Don't come any closer.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Are you serious?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
They think it's school-related?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
What am I? The beer wench?
That's not necessary.  You're in.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
Where was the girl?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
You should be thanking me.
Just keep leading the way.
Here he comes.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
You just met me.
Who said this was murder?
No one yet.
Is that clear?
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
What about sports?
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
No fingerprints?
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
It is Victor.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Wait... just wait.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
Think about it...
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Well... what the fuck, man?
I don't see anything.
It surprises me.  It really does.
You should look into private schools.
But Mose Harper said...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
It was, I tell you!
You got any more orders, Captain?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Talk!
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Futterman?
You ask her!
I think maybe we oughta...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
She's not a little girl any more.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Where?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Who's that?
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
It's good.
Lady?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
The title?
On my mother's side the Ardens
When?
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
No Juliet?!
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
God be praised!  Locked?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Fifty pounds? What for?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Verona again.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
"I know not."
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"Madam!"
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
But the plague
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Can you love a fool?
Even your play.
Oh
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
There is time. It is still dark.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
Nor you for me.
You flatter, my lord.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
All right, just a few questions.
In the same fashion as chess.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
I don't have time.
Come on, David.
He's still here.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I don't know.
But not quite.
Don't you worry about that.
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
I don't know.
Looking for you? Yes.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
What does it look like?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Yes.
Did you know --
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
Well, she had problems --
-- which is --
Hugo.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
You want me to kick it open?
I wonder how he did it?
Did what?
Alex.
Don't look?
No.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Who's going to do it?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
You know we're right.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Later. But first -- him.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
And the money?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Downstairs.
I see.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
What?
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
Eh, I don't know.
What do we do here, David?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
But they sneer, don't they?
Hello.
What guy?
You must be Hugo.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Sorry?
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Then what's the problem?
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
What?
I don't know.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
What?
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Your husband?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
That headboard.
Her?
Yeah.
No thanks.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Great.
You do it.
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
No, thanks.
Probably the bathroom.
You would?
Jill's coming with us.
Great.
What's wrong?
I just have to do one little thing.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
-- this guy with Jill.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Jackie, can we --
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
Sammy's?
Mmmm --
Why?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
It's too late...
I'm busy, man.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What's gonna happen?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You've never even been around one.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Great.
Yeah.
George.
When can I talk to you?
About what?
When is that?
Jill says nothing.
I know, honey.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- go ahead.
I don't want to fight, George.
Didn't you, baby?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
But what?
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
... this doing hair it's...
Oh, hey...
Well anyway...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
I wanna hear about it.
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
I know.
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.

I'll call you back.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
I was too old.
Is that right?
Of course not.
You and your touchy investors.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jackie Shawn.
-- you phony asshole --
Oh yeah?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Don't be silly.
It must be something.
Well, you know what I mean.
Jackie --
Well yes -- you know that about George.
I would say so, yes.
Didn't you have any panties on?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Oh. thank you.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Is he an enemy?
-- never mind.
-- there's not much room --
Have they sat down?
You mean they ate each other up?
Yes, Dad.
I don't know.
Okay, Mom.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Red Rum.
No.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Oh,
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
How did he manage to do that?
A nigger.
A nigger!
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Hi, babe.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Yes, I did.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Rats...
No.
Don't call me dear boy.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Yeah? Really?
But how?
How come?  Sister?
And you listen to that?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
You bastard!
No... it's fine.
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Just about.  Show me again.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Chops?
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Like this place?
Shirelles.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Three years.  Sister.
You have to help me
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Excuse me?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
I see.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
My what?
And whom would you call?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Like what?
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Where's who?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
A sweater.
Peace on Earth.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
I lied.
Where?
Who took the meat?
They spend two days in chains.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
The Widow Windsor.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Listen.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
In test... what?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
This is farewell.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
He has proposed to me twice.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
What?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What are you doing?
What is so urgent?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Where are we going?
Ichabod...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Father saw you die.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Did you decide, sir?
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
No sir.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Sure, I guess.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
Why? Hi, Karl.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Why'd you live there?
Yeah.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Yeah.
Where'd you get them flowers?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
You want to go with me?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yeah, I recollect it.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Why not? It died?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
You will? For sure?
Yeah, I guess.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Did Karl go to bed?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I want to come back and stay here.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Karl, you up?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
What about me?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Yes sir.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
I didn't mean that.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Where will he go?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
What happened?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
What's the difference?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Uh, better make it one.
I'm all ears.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
She probably died.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
What's this?
Five thousand bucks.
I almost got married once.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
And why the hell would you give me money?
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
And how much are these?
And these?
The refrigerator?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
And you told your nephew about it?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
You going to sit here all day?
It was just a thought.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Well, if you put it that way...
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's where the what comes in.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Appreciation for what?
Where did you get that thing?
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
And?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Celebrate? What for?
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
It wasn't my fault.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Still lashed to the mast.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
White or black?
And what's that?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I already said that, b...
Can I say something, here?
Are you absol...
Carl never lied.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Thank you ever so.
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
No we're not.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
Now you've done it!
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Me?  After Sugar?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
Oh, he does!
He's going to be ashore with you.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
I'll say there is!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Oh.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
We'll take a rain check.
Are my seams straight?
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
That's ridiculous.
I'm a very sick girl.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
What do you think you're doing?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
And I can never have children.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
What's the job?
Why?
Because I got some plans -
Tell what?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Afford it?
I'll say.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
About what?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
You're entitled.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Would you mind terribly?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
For your own amusement?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- riding to hounds -
Oh?
Shell Oil?
What?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Oh - in here.
Look at all that silverware.
Where's your shell collection?
What's on Thursdays?
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
You poor, poor boy.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Anything this time?
Tomorrow night?
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Daphne -
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
I never join nothin'.
We got different information.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
And who runs it?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
What’s his problem?
What?
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
And Kat was fully clothed.
Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
It’s hard to explain.
Come on.
Are you sure?
But nothing did.
You have had girlfriends?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
You would do that, wouldn't you?
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Who's winning, Mama?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's wrong with him, David?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
Hello, David...
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Doggy.
Montana.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Cartman?!
CARTMAN!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Goodnight, honey.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
You've got a stupid accent too.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Purpre mama!
Ber dada!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mrph?
That's gonna take a long time!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Oh, brother.
Stan!
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Huh?
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
The F word?!
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Hello, Conan!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You don't care.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Yeah!
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Got it.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
What did you say to me?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I'll do my best.
Hopefully sooner than later.
We have room!  Let's go!
I'm homesick.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Is it safe for human transport?
You're not from around here, are you?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Three whips. To go.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
La da da dalala...
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Theo.
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years! 
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
The small ball.
I'm your blood.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Hello, mom?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Cool!
Buzz Fazeli.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Where's Junior?
Grasp firmly. Then what?
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
This is a vicious cycle.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
The mental hospital.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Why were you suspended?
Plan B is your dad.
More than you could afford.
You told Junior that we did it.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
What about plan C?
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
They told me about sixty hours.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
How deep is he?
A thousand feet.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
She should've known better.
When was this?
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Ted?  Captain?
Yes, Harry.
Gimme a report, I want --
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
A half a mile long?
Some sort of lead or something.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Because when we get down there --
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
My gosh, Norman.
What?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
You went through Edmunds' things?
You said something to him, didn't you?
Four days?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Wait a second --
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Manifested?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
But why is he doing it?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Riordan?
How long does it last?
It's getting cold.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Are you manifesting them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
You think I manifested the snakes?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Is it coming from our own computer?
What?
This answers one of our questions.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Norman?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
... you there?  Norman?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hold on.
Well, press something!
How's that working out, by the way?
You mean forget?
What'd you say to him?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
English?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
The ships?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean a picture?
Please, Ted.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Well, he's polite.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
How much do you think she's talking about?
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I know that.
You saw through me?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
I found it... It's just not there.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Why didn't you say so before.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
See Threepio... do you copy?
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
It's what I deserve.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Sir, no, sir.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
I don't believe it !
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
A funeral.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
No thanks, Diz.
Cover me.
You used to dance...
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Hi, mom.
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Hit your jets, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
You are what...?
May I ask Why?
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Granted.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
Forward motion, Captain...!
Hello, Ilia.
Mr. Spock?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
Child...!?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Why aren't you on board?
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Evening, Annie.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
What's it called?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
But, but but but...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
And likewise.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
...such a pleasant sound.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
About <u>conflict</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
Cast stood me up.
You like kids?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
The other side.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
What's the scene...
...yes.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
What courthouse?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
He's on the ph...
Wat...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
What I...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
It's night.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Wally...
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
...yes...
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Kiss my ass.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Town's out of lilacs.
We're out of money.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
I know the feeling.
I want to make a good film.
You want me to lie.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
For what cause?
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
How was your flight?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
I don't got the money.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Is that one hell of a kid?
She wasn't in...you were al...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I want them thrown in jail.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
George, that is so kind of you.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
That happens.  To families.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
You don't like his friends.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
This is my house too!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Great.  Big ears, too?
But you told us to starve.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Before you.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Rache says it's from you.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
You're WHERE?
Still, please.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
WE are over.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
But it's not on the schedule!
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
She was angry at herself.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
You bet you are.
I really look like shit.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
It's just not the right time t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You'll learn.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Out! Leave the table!
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Yes, Mikey?
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
My grandchild-baby.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
So whaddya think?
Nothing, I guess…
What?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What do you want?
But what kind of pull did you have?
What DO you know?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Hey, Mikey!
What are you doing here?
Ni...
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Who is this?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I believe it.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What is most important to you?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
What are we going to do!
We don't have time!
What do you mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
How's the arm?
Are you going to kill us?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Good.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
If I don't get power up we are!
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Yes?
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
That's right, sir.
Who do you think you're talking to?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
I suppose they are, sir.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
They're coming in now.
How many planes did we lose?
Yes?
What?
War.
Yeah?
So am I.
Where'd they get you?
No kidding.
Recall what mistake?
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
We are?
Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Oh.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Sorry.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
That sounds so depressing.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Fuck it!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
No.
Come on.
So, how was the ride, kids?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
It's nice here. It's different.
A Porsche.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Mm.
What was your name again?
It's a mistake to think that.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
Hi.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
That chick, Erica?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
What?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
About what?
Of course I do!
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Your completely missing the point.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
How?
Nothing.
New ground?
No, no.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah?
For a while.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Ready?
New York, huh?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
If...
Soon.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Tim?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Cleo!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
No.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Hi, Jack.
Yeah.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Yeah, hold on.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
More proof God's a guy...
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
I didn't mean to --
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
What assistant?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Just a minute, you!
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You can stay here.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Cut away from me?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
I don't need a tuxedo.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Who?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
A little.
Keep it.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
Good night.
Why do you say that?
I went for a walk.
Madame is waiting.
I made your bed this afternoon.
How is she?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
No?
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Who?
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But what will happen?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Home?
She didn't take it from you, did she?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
We're from different worlds.
No.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Hey! Ethan!
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.
There isn't any.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I'd rather not talk about it.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
No thanks. You go on.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That horrible woman!
What are you talkin' about?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
It sure is.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
There's a lot of choices here.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Sure.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Thirty-five.
A television set?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
First paycheck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Say what?
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Which country?
Wipe 'em out?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Now...when do I get a taste?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
You designed it?
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
You want to mess with Superman?
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
Who is she?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Oh, Superman!
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
She's not his mama either.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Anybody been hurt?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Actually, yes.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Sleep well?
I'm sorry.
You're not selfish at all.
What else could I do?
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
You do?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Mush!  Mush!
Artemis? Do you read me?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Impossible? Why?
Yes, darling?
Who?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
No.
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Know what?
Can I take you to the airport?
I'm telling you, I was there.
It wasn't a trick!
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Is that what they're calling him?
Screaming
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
You think he's for real?
Nuts. He made it.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
You got wax in your ears?
I mean the other one!
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Folks'll ask question.
-- as we will be.
He'll be weightless.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Enjoyed it?
No! You couldn't imagine -
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Superman???
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Sort of.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
So there were others?
Case?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Because it's what we have to do.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Have you been waiting long?
Good night, Billy.
You believe that?
Why?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You want a cup of tea or something?
So do you like your new room?
No.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
I have no questions.
Tell me about it.
I'm in a car wash.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Why can't you talk to me?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
Yes, I understand.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Why not?
That was great.
What took so long?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
No.
Great.
Yes.
I don't know.
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
He's somewhere...
Come on boys, break it up...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Why, has he bothered you before?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Match me, Sidney...
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
You print them, don't you?
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
When?
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
He goes out with girls.
What about?
I don't think so.
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Back?
What would you think of me if -
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Take a top coat.
What's the matter?
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Why not you?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Yes, but why?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
What does that mean?
Radical.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
You have to do what I say?!
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Why?
Does it hurt?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Smile?
We don't have much time.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Out of the way, John!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know!
Can it be destroyed?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Relax now, Sarah --
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
What the hell are they doing?
Five minutes.
Your manner.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
With more what? More what?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
What museum?
You live here, in Berlin?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Major, Major... he's here ...
What's not right?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
I was warned.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what did he say?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Of course I know what that is.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Alright!
Can you handle it?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
You're a big help.
The what?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
You volunteered?
What about it?
Not possible.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Here, drink some of this...
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Call her.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
See you around.
Don't even think about it.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Never did catch your name.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Is this you?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Where'd you get that... ?
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Underwear?
You look good.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Like a stroke?
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Tell me where we're going.
Yeah, almost...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
It's them.  They did this.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Is everything alright?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Did you worry about him?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Well, I... uh...
That could have been worse.
Sure.
It's a question.
You used the wrong test.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
All the carvings.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
How'd I know it was for you?
What do you want?
Why do you need a chain like that?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
How could he have left without his keys?
What's his first name?
Well?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Are you sure?
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
You think I'm staying?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Been to the Boat Show.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Did Jenny know?
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
No one else is even here yet.
That would be too easy.
I've been wondering something.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
How'd you manage that, then.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Tell us about it.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
What's in Big Sur?
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
You sure?
No kidding.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Yeah.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
You bet.
Like what.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
You know her?
You've made it ... brighter.
-- You know his name is Frank.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Yes, Ann?
...Yes?
Hello, Birdy.
Huh.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
That right.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
No problem!
Cash.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
So?
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Ed, how're you holding up?
That was quite something.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
...Ed?
Jesus...
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
I don't understand.
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Where's the walk-in safe?
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
So the method of death is the only connection?
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
Apparently it's huge.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
I'm coming with you.
What's that?
Yes, I do.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Mbwun.
What do you make of it, Margo?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Eats them?
And John?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Help someone!
We're not going to make the storage room!
Viti Levu.  For how many?
One.
We're not watching the sea.
Welcome.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What's that?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
I won't be late.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I know.
How do you know?
So why do you want to go?
Truman, that was our house!
There's been an accident, Truman.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
--Darling--
You got it.
The whole area's being evacuated.
I don't understand.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
I'm looking for him.
What's that?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
Do I know you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Mulder -- it's me --
Mulder...?
Scully?
You're... quitting?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
Why are you whispering?
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
What did you find?
This looks like new grass to you?
All the equipment is brand new.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Where'd they go?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Where are we?
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
About what?
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
How deep does this go?
Where's Scully?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What do you mean, walked?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Did we go sailing?
She adores you.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
What did you see?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Thank you.
You liked him?
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
That's a secret.
How is she?
Here he is.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
I don't have to.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Do you understand German?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
What's she talking about?
Drink?
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
How do you know?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
...parents.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Joseph Harbin...
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
...to him.
Ever seen one?
Get the next plane.
Next, Paine.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
Didn't I?
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
You do!
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Who?
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Not yet.
Hear the details.
Already gone.
Baron Kurtz.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
That's all you meant?
Mr. Martins...
Excuse me.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
So?
So how many miles do you think it is?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
But he has been there, off course.
Have you told someone?
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
No one follows that midrash.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Are they still together?
Why won't you talk to me?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
No.
What do you care?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
What's it about?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Fuck that.
No, I think you shouldn't.
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I agree.
A poison...?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
And? WHat did you notice?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
I always won.
I can't help what I think.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
What are you doing here?
I've got to get back to the --
Isn't it true?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
Where?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Who'd you kill?
What are you trying to say?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Who's this?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
They're not that Jewish.
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you going to keep it?
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Johana, am I boring you?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
I tell you she's mine!
Yes.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Checking out the competition.
He can learn.  He is learning.
How did it happen?
Dollars.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
... What's your name again?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
Enzo?
Why?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
I'm still here.
Then, tell me a story.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I didn't dive.
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Johana... New York.
You called the police?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
It's his heartbeat.
What are they for?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Keep going.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
So don't show a picture.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
You okay?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Is he in love with you?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I sleep it off.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Yes?
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
To the eye? Like other men.
Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait ——
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Get it out of here!
On his back, I suppose.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
That might depend on where you’re going.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Laurence!
Mr Lombard?
Mr Lombard...
When did you get back?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Leon could still have hung himself.
You bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...We’re turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
So you did talk about it, huh?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Croissants.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
Then find another way.
We’ve still got the Italian...
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
The company. We all work for the company.
What’s the Ambassador?
B-Black...
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
May I...?
Okay. Recommended...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Any friends?
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Am I supposed to know him?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
You seem very sure about that.
Yeah.
Five to three. You’re early.
Have you?
Evening. Table for one?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
No...
What about which girlfriend?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Cinq cents.
What do you think, huh?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I am ready now...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I'm staying, Jean.
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Quite a few.
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Where... where am I?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Please... may I have it back...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
... You look wonderful...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Does he have hair?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
We need another ten minutes...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
No.
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
What are you doing out here?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why not?
They won't come anyway.
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Someone you know?
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Halina?
What?
What?
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
To be deaf?
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
What's he say?
No.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
What?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What on?
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Play a gig.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
If that's the way you want it.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Hackers.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
We'll get by without 'em.
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Then why you doin' it?
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
What's the problem?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
She coulda killed me last night.
Who are you?
I'll square it with the fixer.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
What time you get off work here?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
I feel lucky tonight.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
Why don't ya then.
What happened?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
For fifteen years.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Yes, she would.
This is my wedding.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Only in bad weather.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Not a thing.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about this Nunheim?
He's holding out on you.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
When was that?
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I got word from Wynant this morning...
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
But what if you need more money?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
It might.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
All right - you didn't.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
Pretty girl.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No.
No thanks.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Yes.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
It was his body that was buried there.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Mimi...
I wish you'd tell me who.
I don't know.
You his wife?
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Home?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
Wha...
What do you figure it to be?
Where'd they go?
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What about the gold?
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
You don't know that.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Just be cool.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're going to be fine.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
X marks the spot.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Sure.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
What did you say?
Oh, God...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Woods.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
Jaeger?
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Iraqis.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
You down?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
What did you get?
What are you doing?
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
They're watching us now.
THX!
What?
What kind of answer is that?
Yes.
Yes...
Where are they?
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
What... ?
Right.
"Punks", huh?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
What do ay say?
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
What is that?
Why are we stopping here?
No... No more killing.
Who are you calling, sis?
What about the ballistics report?
Oh shit...
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
What?
Yes.
No!
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
And harems ... ?
Good morning, Major.
Smart. London, eh?
Yes, Baron.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
I want to see-- 
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
I hope so, too.
Two weeks and three days.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Otherwise I'll call the police
M'sieu ...
Just as you say, Doctor.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Now just a minute, Major--
I would like to.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
What?
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Lily, you must listen to me.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Too much blue in crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
Yes.
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Oh? 
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Together.
Good night.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
You would?
Like that!
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Giron...!
Lovely.
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
For all the really important things--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
He started it.
That's true.
No--I'm sorry.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Shit.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
An accident?!
You're precious to me, Rose.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
Almost as good as you.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
The boats are all going.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Hello again.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
May I cut in, miss?
Are you nervous?
This is crazy.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
This is horseshit.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's so cold.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
April 14, 1912.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
It's so unfair.
Anya!
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Will you pardon me?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
I'm so sorry!
You've got lipstick all over you.
Good-by.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Well, I can't.
When?
Okay.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
A dollar forty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Inspector McKinney.
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Three Jacks.
How's your mother feeling?
I thought you were a sucker--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Sure, I'll go.
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
That's too bad.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Yes--Me--in person!
I was never stiffer in my life.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Very serious?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So what?
Can you read 'em Jack?
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
He said to turn loose of him.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
You don't even know him.
Better.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Satisfied?
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
That's great coming from you.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
How would you know?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Wyatt!  My God...
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
'Least they don't scare women.
Yeah?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Acquired?
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
How did you get this number?
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
...And what's that, my dear?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
- We all want what we can't have?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Is that any way to say hello?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
Nice to run into you again.
- You're not.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
What the hell does that do?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
And when might that be?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
You won't get away with this!
That was too close.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Yes. Shall we kill them?
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Please sir. Please -
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Hush.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I'm worn out.
It's good to be able to hear that.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Good afternoon, ladies.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
What's a toby?
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Where is Skip?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Where was the last place you left him?
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
But what if we leave them behind?
What?  What is it?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Which one can I open first?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Hello-o-o...
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Don't tell me what to do!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Great!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
You murdering dog!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Last present!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
He made that. In his off hours.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Stop it!
Reprieve.
H'm?
Did you now.
How long has -
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's not here.
Why does he need money?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Did you get it?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
So my wife is lying?
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Private?
What's that mean?
You do?  What else you do?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
What do you think she wants?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Yes.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
It's where I live.
Sorry.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
So why have you told me about it?
So, what's he like?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
There's no need.
It's no problem.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
The park?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
It was my fucking television.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Following new course. Warp seven.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
I don't understand.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
Yes, Captain?
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Is it possible?
I believe I have found a faster way.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
What are you doing?
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.






"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Are you embezzling?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
To warn him.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
You said it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Yes?
Well I want to communicate --
Who is your User, program?
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Alan!
Greetings, program...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Wait...I need that...
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
What do you think?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
What is it?
I'm shocked.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Can you cover me for an hour?
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
I thought you moved out.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Put a tap on her phone.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
You tell on me, I tell on you.
She could be telling the truth.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Yes sir.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
It's certainly... dramatic.
That's fabulous Harry.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
They said you had to run out.
Why did you continue to see him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
My husband can't know about this.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
So what's your angle?
Yeeaoowww!!
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Get going! 
Boris and Doris?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
That was you?!
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Gotten your mail yet?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
I don't remember.
What's your favorite color?
Like it?
What are your turn-ons?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
I think what you did was...
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
No thanks.
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Clarence sent a letter?
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
You goin' out?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
The zoo.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
He wants to talk ya.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
We grew up together.
I really don't know.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I'm your son.
Nope.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
McTeague.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Or a supporting actor -
Rock whores.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Preach on, Big D.
Exactly room-mates.
Yes.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Women will want to get to know you...
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I have to go.
1995?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
They're keeping an eye on me.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
Mason???
The guy was a total fruitcake.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
Give me the gun.
It was?  I didn't...know.
What does this mean to you?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
Well, you look pretty different, too.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What...???
How did you find me?
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
What...virus?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
I need a ticket.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Accident.
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
What?
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
Open up!
Yes.  Yes it is.
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
What do you want?
Jesus.
That a fact?
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
A medicine man?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I don't know how.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Take me with you.
How much money has he got?
Shit!
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Because I know you're full of shit.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
If you want.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
You heard me.  Count it out.
You killed him!
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Where the hell am I going to go?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
No.  I swear it.
Someone will find me.
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
Accident.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hey!
Like you don't know.
Why would I kill her?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I do.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
How do you put a price on murder?
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Jake--
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
But you was going to fight for me.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
What for?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Christ, I don't believe this!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Accident.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
California...
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
And what does that make you?
Next time you'll do just fine.
Shhh! Liar.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
But you was going to fight for me.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Accident.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What sign?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the sheriff.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You're welcome, Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
What?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Is that why you're with him?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Where to?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
You didn't hear something?
Proceed.
Is that the entire message?
How old is Jeb?
What did I say?
I'm listening.
I don't know. It's been a while.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Oh shit...
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
I don't know Megan.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's he talking about?
I assumed because of the train.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
I have to go now.
Quick.
That's not what I witnessed David.
Are you finished?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
What's he look like?
I'm going to go in.
What do you do if something happens?
All of it.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
We was... lyin'.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
He tell you where them others is?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Free ones?
Oh. Yeah.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You could run off them two cowboys.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
N-no, sir?
I could of... easy.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
When we gonna double back?
Yeah, he's in there.
Did... you... get... him?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Two weeks, I guess.
Three ways?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
He musta been movin' right along.
Well, she...
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He hit you?
Beats the hell out of me.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Worms was comin' out.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Tom?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Yeah?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
I love you.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Get out.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Three million?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
You're lying.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
I know he was good.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He loved her.
So this lawyer...
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Why didn't you say anything?
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
This is all bullshit.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
You thought it was just.
It looks that way.
Yes.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Yes!
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
You would not...?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I...
They lied.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
The most respected ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Why is that?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I object, your Honor...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Yes.  Price...
And are they going to get it?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Thank you.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
You got a good memory, Franky.
So what?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... I understand ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
I just saw her.
Thank you.
Kathy Price...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
What did she say?
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Yes, the roving nurse...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Interesting business.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
But you knew about this.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
It's a place to live, that's all.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Just dinner.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
You don't even want to touch me.
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Scottie!
I'm scared.
Scottie, please...!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
What are you going to do?
Where were you?
This afternoon.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
No.
How old?
What are you thinking?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Here with you.
The tall trees...
No!
No, I can't tell you!
A grave...
Tell me.
You believe that I love you?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
What do you mean?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Well?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Here you are.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
How soon can it be altered?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Wait. Wait a minute.
I am not flexible on this.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Real times.
My god.
Well, oh...
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Is everything okay?
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
He's cracked up.
What's your point?
Fine? Fine what?
I'm serious.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
What's your point?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Not really, no.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Ball park sausages.
How about my Fatburger?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
The wedding cake check?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think so.
Why did you forget the tent check?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've seen it on television.
With all my heart.
I need your help.
Well I do.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Can we just talk this out?
Do you love me?
You fucked a prostitute?
But...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
I think so.
A move?
My God...
You alright?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Are there many windows?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
How long are you staying?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
How much is that?
My God, what have you done to him!
Me, rich? Come on!
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Is she coming back?
No.
How much do you want for him?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
What's he called?
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Today, a good girl.
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How do you kill it?
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Give me your wrist.
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Start of what?
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
We know you didn't kill those guards.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Nice work.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...

Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"...

String a few together.  All I need's eleven,

Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.

They'll be here in ten minutes.
Watch me.

No, I think..
Oh really.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
...well, see him?
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
Coulda been a contender.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Okay.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
I don't understand.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
What about hard work?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
How much?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
He did?
Yeah 
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hmm.
Hello?
No Jonathan.
That's not what you said last night.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
No thank you sir we're fine.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
That was very good.
Did you?
Your husband?
Fireball?
How do you know it's a she?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
Have you been hurt?
What?
Almost.
Who's that?
Oh-kay...
Um...yes.
I've seen you.  From the window.
This fence...it's so...
Mrs. Frank?
You look a little old for a student.
What was her major?
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
Good.  I'm good.
You are?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
Mef?  What's Mef?
It's alright.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
I can't believe this is happening.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
When's she out of here?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Don't.
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Fine.
It's just us now.
Of him I think.
Why?
Norman, you have to look at this!
Did you call the police?
You are so brilliant.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
...Don't get all...
Norman...
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
Keep your voice down.
I may have seen her on campus.
Not personally.
The...
...Please stop...
Ow!
What's the matter?
Who?
I never asked you to quit!
Claire...
What?
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
There are two.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
My...mother...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I don't want the -
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
It wes a dream...!
Lasher - bring us through!
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
It is from love.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
What do you see...?
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
You can't just -
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
Papers...?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
I don't know
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
What did you do with her?
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
You've killed but you're not a killer
Why should I?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
First finish your tea...
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Which you pulled, hard!
You have changed since second grade.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
The lesson being?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Son.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Sorry I--
You do know how to drive?
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are they okay?
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Your dad taught you everything.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Maybe someday.
That's hard to believe.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
That's part of growing up, honey.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Only the best for my mother.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Of course I like girls.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
You think we should be more open minded?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
People pay good money for that?
Kelly Van Ryan...
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Then what?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
The skinny brunette.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Where's this coming from?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
What are you looking at?
Get off my property.
Okay, what's the matter?
What?
Where, the mall?
Don't forget the car wash.
We have to stick with the plan.
Duquette.  Forget him...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
You think that's wise?
There's nothing for them to get.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
About what?
I had to go look for this coupon.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Sandy... What's up?
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Put them all together and what do we have?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
I know!  I know!
It was in your book.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Your guests, ma'am?
My.  It's gotten longer.
Private train?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
I beg your pardon?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Yes...?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Are you a warrior?
Fresh goat's milk.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
You must learn magic.
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
How am I gonna do that?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Are you sure?
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Who??
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
John, I don't understand any of this.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I thought I was the English.
Nail it!
I saw him.
Hey, Sam...
What are you going to do?
What have you got?
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
You have no right to keep us here.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
But why would they murder...
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
That's your way, not mine.
You're the first one he'll contact.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Is the English dead?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
She say where he is?
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
...have you come back?
...resourceful!
Who are you?
Uhhhh -- yes...
I don't believe you!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
I thought you said she was dead.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Are you ready now?
How did you guess?
Aw, come, come, come --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
And bears!
No.  Why only --  Oh --
...yes.
Oh.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
They would?
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Ah --
Dorothy!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
Elektra King.
Makes her look even more innocent.
The King pipeline.
Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
Old friend?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Who did you get it from?
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
How long has he been with you?
Does this look familiar to you?
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
...what?
I could have given you the world.
I thought you were the one in her business.
Mother of God.
The Maiden’s Tower.
What is this place?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Wrong answers?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Blake?  Dead?
Mm hmm.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
The missing scientists.
What??
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Damn straight.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
They're practically on us . . .
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
What happened?
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Maybe I'll do that.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
New information.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Is that all?
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What do you get if you finish?
Like what?
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Go to hell.
What are you?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Where are we going?
Did you do your homework?
You can't talk to it?
What was that for?
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
This is your standard dart gun.
I can see that. Why?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
You're serious?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Sit down.
Here we go again.
Nice hops.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
What's "Anarchy 99"?
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I do love a good check mate.
What do you want?
Who?
Now that's Magneto talking.
He helped you?
Don't you knock?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
A piece.  Only a piece.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Yes, my dear, he is.
What was your grandfather's name?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir?
Is it that music?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Promise??
I promise.
