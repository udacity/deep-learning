Forget French.
Where?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
The "real you".
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
You did what?
Exactly my point
So they tell me...
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
No, I ' m not.
We're not.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
William would never have gone to a state school.
You didn't
William - he asked me to meet him here.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Just let me sit down.
You know what they say
Busy
I'm gettin' there
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Hearsay.
Why not?
I didn't care about the money.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
With the teeth of your zipper?
You're not helping.
That ' s what I thought
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You don't usually ask.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
We can't be.
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Divorced.
What about back home?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'll make some for us.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was that, Korfin?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
A timer.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
You know what I'm saying here.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Answer it.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm not moody.
Not what.  Who.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Where's Czech girl?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
We have no money.  Come on.
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Good idea!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
I used an accelerant.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Not good.
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
It's possible.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I guess not.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Did they have any explanation for this?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
I want to pick up my car.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Want to try it again?
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
The bet's off.
How much?
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
You stay with me...
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I don't know.
When? How?
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
That's the way I see it, too.
You made the front page.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shut up.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
You chickenshit punk...
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I know...
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
That's what I thought.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Yes. Of course..
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Vito Cornelius?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
We will be ready, Lord.
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
He's on vacation.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Not without Leeloo.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
And the third one?
Why not?
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Oh, yes you will...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
It's difficult.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Protect life... Until death.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Wait or act.
Amen..
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Got it.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You're killing me...
Mrs. Christian.
There's nothing harder.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Is it?
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Take out your gun!
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Eddie.
How much did he pay you?
Why?
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Good for you.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Child pornography.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Alright, I get the picture.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You've found missing persons before.
Okay.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Of course.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Kristen...
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
I'm sure they're around.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Then what else can we do?
You just feel sorry for me.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
You don't get it, he's after me...
My name is...
Been having bad dreams.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Mark!
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Meaning?
My father!  He's not - ?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
I'm with <u>you!</u>
What about down?
The frogmen?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Under <u>water</u>?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
Thirty-four seconds!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Come where?
Why?
I'll be another!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Who?
You don't believe me?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
You think so.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Yeah.
Piece of fucking cake.
On your sleeve.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I called Mommy.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
Oh.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Oh.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
Something bugging you?
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
Want to buy?
Where's Jill?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Yeah. I mean that.
Okay.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
It's nice.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Think they're alright?
How?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Can --?
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Can't it wait, then?
What?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Yeah.
In the living room.
Crawl!
No shit.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Then who shot him?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Wade, are you alright?
I'm sorry, honey.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Got it.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Ga get it.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Stand by.
Copy, Air Force One.
What do you know of my husband?
Say something dear.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
They've gotta be joking.
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
I was reading too.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
I mean until we start to burn up.
You mean...
I mean for Ted.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Go ahead.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Yeah.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
I don't want to hear that word!
What?
You're sure?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
But if you'll just give me...
I love you, Elaine.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Here.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
The cockpit? What is it?
Show me.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Did you learn anything?
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
To the... to the beach?
You must leave me alone on this.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Harcourt is dead.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Could it be intelligent?
See you soon.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
She's right.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Yes, Hicks?
Alive?
Sure, Hicks.
About seventeen days.
On my way.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Just get back here!
Yeah.  What?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Terrible.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
No, it's different, honey.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Newt, wait!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Sweet Jesus.
Indeed.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
I'm so relieved.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Yes!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
Why not?
Yes.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Money! Money!
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
Be careful!
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
And the result satisfies.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Oh?
What? On one hearing only?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Thank you, Sire!
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Well. There it is.
Yes, what about him?
Is she not here?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Pupils?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Not that I've seen.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I don't know. He has pains.
So there you are. What do you say?
Yes.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
Of course not.
I'm afraid not.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Do you mean that?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Do you believe in it?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
I think so.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
You go fast!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Baron!
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Leave me alone.
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Ah - you've heard that?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Exactly.
The Emperor has given him permission.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Who is she?
Go about your duties.
What exactly did he call out?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Yes, Doctor.
Shall I send a car?
I beg your pardon?
Aw come on, Alex!
I thought you were asleep.
I dream of death mostly.
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
That's easy enough.
Not just a patient -- me.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I was dreaming again?
It's nice to see you.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Pull over.
No.
No what?
I looked.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
That's very funny, that is.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Right.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Where are we going?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Get out of here, Jack!
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Hello.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Sorry, love.
But listen, Tom, I—
Why not?
Matt?
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
You understand?
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Good for you. Come on.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
I haven't any.
Why, I don't know.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Yes, sir.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Yes.
If he can do it, yes.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Did you get the case for the securities?
He's at a board meeting.
No.
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
wasn't anywhere near this place—
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
How?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Tell me.
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Pass me some whisky.
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
My little Web did that?
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Hell of a war.
You're doing just fine.
Maybe, maybe...
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
Got any ideas, little brother?
Jim was old enough...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
Everything but the boring parts.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
But you got big!
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
You are a hell of a woman.
That's the idea.
You cocky little bastard.
Thanks.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Really?
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
It is a nice piece of writing.
On a lot of lithium?
I can't.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
I'm ignoring you.
Alright.
Do...what.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Everybody's rich.
Everybody has a great body now.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
But where?
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Nice.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Uh huh.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
What?
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Like what?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
After six.
I'll do it.
Dorsia is...fine.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Jean-I'm not-
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Uh huh?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Who?
No.
Does he do this all the time?
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
I know. I'm sorry.
Where did Paul hang out?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Actually, yes.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Suit yourself, I guess.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I'm so hungry.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Didn't you visit the campus?
What're you -- what?
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
It's gonna get cold.
He wasn't acting?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's what I told her. My wife.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Just do what I'm asking!
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Long story. Not that interesting.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Thank God.
But you said the other --
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Thank you, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
Thank you, Basil.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Yes, Basil?
Be careful!
Hey, Mick!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm sorry.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Not in the Nineties.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Oh, behave!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Lay it on me.
Behave!
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Dr. Evil?
Sea bass.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
... love...
Peter ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You mean you don't recall??
Sir August...?  What now?
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Looks like rain, Steed...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
We want to help...!
To you ... ?
Thank you, Steed.
An unholy trinity ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
1922. Why the kippers?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
I didn't. Mother did.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Strange.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
You're playing games.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
You lied.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
You first.
But --
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
I know all this.
Who's now vanished.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Mother and Father know best.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I feel sure of it.
The last one you'll ever see.
But did they teach you this?
If you say so.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Oh, come on, just a little.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
So does Debbie.
Yes, sir.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm going now, Cole.
About what?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
You're really pissing me off.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I am committed. I love you.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
You know your father enjoys his company.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Screw that.
Yes.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Milt?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
You've been having strange sex...!
I'm separated.
The best table in the house.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
I'm proud of you, lad.
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'm saved. Let's party!
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Yeah...
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
He's alive.
Who asked you?
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
That was never proved.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Brian, look --
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I'll handle it.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
The outlets.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
What?
What reason?
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
You look like... Brian.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
What's wrong?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
All right, cop. I want my money.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
What case?
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
YEAH!
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
That can be done.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
You're now Mantan.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm telling you it's not.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
Go on.  Good so far.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
How did you end up here?
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
How so?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Work related or otherwise?
No.
Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
No.
I just turned twenty.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
You've never had any formal training, either?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
I thought you got rid of...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
We can look out for ourselves.
Stop playing me Sloan.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
I have acted as I think fit.
What is the service, sir?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
For whom else have you worked?
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Have you had one?
Never.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
What is to be done?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
May I be quite frank with you?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Shut up.  West's dead.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
That'd be my reaction too --
You saw West's body.
Yeah --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
There were six of us...
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
If not you, then who?
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
No. Poetic justice, though.
My heart weeps.
No. I said Dunbar.
Well?
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Tell me what I can do.
Well, he's a good soldier.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
What the hell are you talking about --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Why?
You made me look like an idiot --
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
They got their stories straight.
You wanted to get the truth.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Wrong answer --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Edward Bloom.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
How did you know?
I'll...
Lucky girl.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Can I take your picture?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
And I like you.
Okay.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Really.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Can we talk?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
How I go.
Really.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going with you.
They met at Auburn.
Mmm, what?
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Such as?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Name it.
Right.
What are you doing here?
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
No, no...
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
Excuse me?
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
Sometimes.
You don't understand you either.
Get out.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
She's alive?
Please.
It's not mine either.
Maybe you will find out.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
Don't make it less true.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
No, ma'am.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
And you gonna live it with him?
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Let go of me...
I don't fuckin' cook.
Sure.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Or what?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Rae...
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I do.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Saving your life.
Nick, we can't just --
Maybe we should bail?
What'd she say?
Where would you look for the mafia?
I don't, that's all.
I'll get him for you, Nick.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
I want to go talk to him.
It's illegal, Nick.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Kampai.
Yes...
I don't give tours.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Where's Ich?
You could fake it.
I don't remember you saying no.
The cheese...
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Why me?
He killed a police officer.
You're foreigners.
Well stocked.
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Pris?
Then go get him.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Like...
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Okay, but...
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Let's hear it.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Me too.
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
You mean the snake.
Sorry.
Why should I be?
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
I'm sorry.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Dead.
I wish I could.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Please.
Yes.
But in your profession that is a risk.
If she is, the machine works.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Don't move.
Sorry.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
They left.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Oh, brother...
Are you French?
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Do you own a car?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Over this?
Take it. damn it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Night!
Sure.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Good for you.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Do I look crazy?
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
How 'bout this one?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
I've got to go, now.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Blow out the candles!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Russia.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
That would knock my father out.
Yes. He likes windows.
Oh. I see.
You bet!
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Say what?!
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Yes, ma'am.
Mom?
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
You bet, hon!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
No.
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
You bet.
And I made these!
No.
I thought ten years.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
What do you think, Adam?
No.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
You're goddamn right I am!
Fallout shelter.
We came back to the house!
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Um...uh...
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
No, not at all.
Not yet.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Nobody.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Well.
No.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
I, uh.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I did. Are you?
Don? Where is he?
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Speak to me Fucker.
Go where?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
What?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay. Great!
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Probably not. No. Why?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Stop it Mike.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Any word back from the E.R.s?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
Be careful.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Rule of thumb?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
Where's my cat?
My, my...
And the pennies?
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Hey, Murph.
You sure you killed them?
So?
Well, I'm sold.
Y-Yes my son.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
I guess not.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Right. The blond guy.
No. This is he.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Yeah, I saw it.
We got it. We got it.
Yeah.
What do you think?
I keep it for emergencies.
Yes, they are.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
What. What's the matter?
Which one was that?
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
This was in fourth grade.
This morning.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
You don't know how to hotwire.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Eleven fifteen.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
He was all right.
As a person?
Yes. I do.
We all set?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Careful. Check his pulse.
Come on, Kumar.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He stole a tractor.
Grammar.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Anthony, I'm petrified.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
I hope not.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
OK, Dad.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
It was stupid.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Not even for emergencies?
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
He electrocuted someone?
That's too bad.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
I'm going back.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Where's Applejack?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
And what does that cover?
He's damn good.
Where?
Is that your chiquita?
What?
Fight. You know.
There was a mistake.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Bourne comes here? Why?
I want to know about Treadstone.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Don't you want answers?
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
No... It must have been Bourne.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
Thanks.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
I killed them.
Look at me.
He's dead.
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
So...
What?
-- where? -
Tell me later.
Get on it.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
No. You never worked Berlin.
I was here!
Sounds like a threat.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
Still...
Some women like Dobermans --
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Yes. In that order.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
It was in Latin, sir.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Wallace's followers.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
You win.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
We don't split up!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
Humbly, M'lord.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Nor I!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Um... can dad come this time?
My father has a bad memory, too?
I... I blacked out.
Sure...
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
I see a car.
I thought you were a December baby.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Duck, here they come.
Hi, Lenny.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
I know, but...
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
I get it. You can drop it now.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Stop! Take me back!
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I don't get it.
And...?
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Me neither.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
And you are...?
Deal. Now read me something.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I'm sorry.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
I'm sorry. It is.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Yes, something.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Good day.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
I don't know the finish yet.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Put them on the table.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- Is what?
How do you do?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Thank you.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Yes.
We'll be there.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I believe you have a message for him?
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
I was misinformed.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
A wise foreign policy.
Our entertainment is enough.
Victor Laszlo?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
His escape.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You think of everything, don't you?
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
Hello Ugarte.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
I don't want them here overnight.
Then don't have a drink.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Catch another fish tomorrow.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Do too much, I'll die.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Then we've just got shit.
Must be a story there.
So do I.
Let's take a look.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Let me guess, Russia came up?
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
I have to.
There isn't any us.
I would never --
I know.
My epitaph.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
And how was your Christmas?
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
I'm doing fine.
I'm touched.
You fucked us over.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
Hallelujah.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
But you had so much *responsibility*.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
*What* will be okay?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Please don't...
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I know what you've been doing.
*Liver* killed him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you grow up around here?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Have you enlisted?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Right.
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
What's lucky about that?
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Two million.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
You're a superstitious fucker.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like what?
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
So we go to the bar.
What's a King Pin?
We're going to give him the money back?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I told you, use less powder.
She's up for it.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Good boy.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
WHAT?
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
You sure we're clear?
Breasts.
We're getting a little old for running.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Do you have a ticket?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Can't say.
So what do you want?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
What do you get out of it?
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
Is it that bad?
All men are cheats.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
What?!
Seven-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Not entirely.
What job?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Are you drunk?
Do you have to swear all the time?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
I hope it brings you luck.
Never. Why do you ask?
Gambling's not about money.
I hate public transport.
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
There's a casino in this hotel.
First visit to London?
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Robbery's not criminal?
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Let it go.
I told you, all bets are off.
Yes.
Jack! It's Jani.
How are you?
You did?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
You're talking about complicity.
We check every four days.
Five.
Very impressive.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
All right, then...
Do you remember the detonation time?
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
Bomb?
Hmmm...
You have no proof that it was correct data.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Fred.
Out where?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
What happened, Doolittle?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Well, what you might try is --
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
We're running out of time, sir.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah?
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
No.
You're not still pissed?
Could you give us a moment.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
Look, I'd really like to...
Girl's gotta make a living.
I was expecting someone else.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
A girl.
Hardly...
What's in it for you?
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
But she does work here?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
Nothing on Hannah?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You're crazy.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
You know what I'm saying.
Where?
I actually know how this works.
You're the best, Maxie.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
She was the one--
He's sick.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
Hawk.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Right, slow...
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Check!
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
DUDES!
Nah. Couldn't be.
Oh, yeah...?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Hawk?
It's my Bullworker.
Check.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
No.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Did you know him?
Donnie.
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
How much longer is this gonna last?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
We never would have had this conversation.
The whole movie. Let's go.
What's wrong with you?
Who's Frank?
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
His name is Frank.
Follow him where?
No.  That's stupid.
Yes.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
That I did it again.
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Why would I tell Mom?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Her name is Gretchen.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
But now you can't go.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
What?!
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Yeah...
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Loretta, shut it.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
Anyone?
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Ohio...
Tammy Curry?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Nothin' too showy!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Yeah.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
The king can do no wrong! 
Take a letter.
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
Yes -- why?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
That's not bad for any day.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Anything else? 
Sure.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
No... it was a seven letter word.
That's it...
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Now -- er --
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
WHAT  ?
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Oh, yes.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Like this. 
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
And what was that, John?
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Yes, I think I can.
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Want to come out?
Yes.
My... name is...
Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Oh yes.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Fine.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
A dressing bag?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
You're losing your temper!
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
But, Father, it IS!
Those things in your hands.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
But, Erik...
Of course.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Yes?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
You don't love ME.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Well you started it.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I don't know! I just did!
It saved my father!
Look out!
So?
Look... Erik...
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Who gets killed?
But how could he know... unless...
We haven't got a spare place.
What d'you expect me to do?
What do we have to do?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Together we stand!
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
So did your father...
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Neither am I.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Tell him I'm coming!
And something to sharpen them with?
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Sweetie, we called the company.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Okay, I guess.
Why what?
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
I don't have one.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Frost?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
You'll call me, right?
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
You're not ready.
Yeah, Tangerine?
What do you mean?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Do you remember what we talked about?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
You said --
Me too. There's this poem --
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
What if you stay this time?
Yeah.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Well... I did.
Hi.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Listen, it's not erasing.
I don't know! I just said that!
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Can I... I brought some --
Nothing.
Is that Nietzsche?
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
I know who you are.
Clockworks.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
Your ranch?
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
I think I found something...
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
I'm telling you, I saw it...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
It gets worse.
90 over 50 and falling... .
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Some things you don't get over.
Yes, sir!
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
If it worked, yes.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
What are you talking about?
What makes you think I'll miss?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Better if I just show you.
Starck... Cooper...
Love to.
We have a situation here...
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Let's go.
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I've got a theory.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
I did.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Yes.
I'm sorry.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I like the sound of that.
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Got it, teach.
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
I though we went over this.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
They're not costumes.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Now.
Johnny.
I think that thing is Ben.
Dude. That's my sister.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Great minds think alike.
Yes, thanks.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Just find him.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
First door on your left!
This is how I dress all the time.
Hey-yo.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
But they weren't mine.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Come on...
What? Now?
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
Really?
Yeah?
Okay. See ya.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
All right.
They're fuckin' with us.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Just be glad you're all right.
My brother is gonna shit.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
So what did you do?
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
What's the big deal?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Thanks a lot.
I paid for it and everything.
Dartmouth?!
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
All right! Oh, yeah!
I don't know. Wherever you want.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naked.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
I have to go.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Are you ready?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Like big lizards.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Lucy is looking for you.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Right!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Nah, I got the gun.
Her fella.
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
There's a tunnel.
What's it for?
Oh yeah?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Really?
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much you got?
What?
He shot you the other time.
Huh?
Holds four.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
Clear!
Gimme the keys.
You keep that key handy.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Am I too heavy for you?
HELLLPPP!
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
And the last one is the...
That's fine.
Well...
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
What're you doing?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Who's this?
You see: We've got to change that name.
Thank you --
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
My clothes?
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Come here. I want to show you something.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Who?
An actress.
Without me.
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
All square, Doc.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Always. Always.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
See you next weekend?
They'll mend.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
Came to get a tan.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
What?
Huh?
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
That would be okay.
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I live here.
What?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
You think I got it?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
...You will.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Go on...
Not long.
Sure.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
I'm going out!
I have!
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
No! No!
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
Why?
Yes. Very close
I am afraid.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
I don't know.
And you look so lovely.
So have I
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
All my life I've known.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.
I will be here when you return.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Thank you, Henry.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
The strain was evident.
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I need you so much, Claudette.
That was the telephone.
You? The brick?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
One night on the town.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
So let's do it.
I'm exhausted.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Yes.
Yes.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Forever together.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Everybody goes home!
Where are you taking us?
What did I say?
Yes.
-- you got your shower --
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
Gotcha!
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
What?
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
My shit is together.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Uh, ma'am.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Sir?
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
Get it up!
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
I oughtta report you.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Thanks, Wick.
They had to kill 'em?
You got anybody, Wick?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
I don't know...
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Big bites.
Where's Audrey?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Yeah, well...
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
What else do you know about it?
That's the problem. He did.
Mr. Caiman...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
I'll try.
Allez, allez!
Where's Luc and Pierre?
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
It's the French Secret Service.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
I had the shot...
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
I played Richard III...
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Could they be the miners?
What?
Yes but, we were wondering-
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
It's suicide.
Your last name.
You smiled at me.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
It helps.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
You have ten seconds.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Theramin.
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
NO, Thank God he has not.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
Tommy, we have these...
And a French alliance?
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Yes, general?
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
I'm not sure.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Lafayette is a child!
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
What's the difference?
A fleet?
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
These supplies...?
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
You're out of your mind!
That land belongs to the strongest.
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I mean I don't care.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Calm down, Bear...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
So... how many movies you been in?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
He's around someplace.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Three.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
You positive about that?
I'm working on a few things.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Ray. Look at me.
Look at me, Ray.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Something shouldn't be there.
Get him out've here.
Leo spanked a waitress?
What've you got?
Where you been, Harry?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
The shylock's the good guy.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
What's it called?
Who's the star?
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
You're kidding, right?
You have it?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
How'd you know I was here?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I know what a vig is.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
...That's what we finally decided.
"Cotton".
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
What do you get out of it?
I want to know.
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You thought I was faking?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Go get your stuff.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
That's what the guy said.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Whatta you doing out there?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Pick 'n' Save.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Chili and me.
Thanks.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Or uninvited guests.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
How long, then?
She take a radio?
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Then you're a lucky man.
Too big. More like a freighter.
It's my pen name.
She was sailing up north, right?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Epps.
If it was a ship she hit.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Over the gold.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Who?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Did you actually do this painting?
I...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
No.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
Hi.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What?
What? Why?
Forget it...
Okay, okay!
Hey, look at this...
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
You loser!
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
There's my dad with Joanie.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
What are you talking about?
Wait...
But those are our people...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Don't worry.
Go ahead...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
What happened to Seymour?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
What are you doing here, Melorra?
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Seymour does.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Where did you get those pants?
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Did you bring that tape?
Well why do I care about that?
Okay.
Wow!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
What, like a girdle?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Oh yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
YAAA!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Can you at least let me in?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
I am.
Talk to us about it...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Why would she be hiding from me?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Do you have a check for me?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
I assure you we came close many times-
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
We need to talk.
Actually, no.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
You give me hope, John. 
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Does he ever mention me?
I won't.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
That's exactly what you said last week.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
Okay, let's take a look.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Ghostbusters.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Who?
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
I hate Jello.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
Are you sick, Louis?
I got the Twister game for later ...
I'll scream.
Goodbye.
Who's the stiff?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Is he dying or something?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
You must have gotten the last copy.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Talk to my accountant. 
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
We'll get back to you.
Is that a game?
In the physical sense.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
In a storage facility.
Yes, it would.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Neutronize.  System shut.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
For what purpose?
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
What?  What popped in there?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
If I may be so bold...
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
They won't break this one.
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Give away food?
Take grain away from the army?
Yes, Caesar.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
God of passages and changes?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
They're studying with Cynics.
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Yes, I do.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
But you're not enrolled.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Come in.
Because -- I am.
What do you think?
I don't feel well.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Why do you have to see him?
Where did he do it?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Yes, I will.
Ahhh.
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
Of course.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
No.
What for?
But it's light in there now.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I want to say something first.
Oh my God.
I've got to go.
Do you want to get it now?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Either one will be fine.
Is this -- what?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Are you tired of it?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
How about art.
Go ahead then.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well I can't.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
At college.
Yes.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
If that's how you feel --
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Well --
About what?
You got me.
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Oh no.
What?
Ben -- how old are you now?
Quite a while.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am not threatening you.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.
Need any help?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
What about the money?
Not with strangers.
Money.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Go away. Who are you --?
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I should like to smoke.
Really?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'll go -- good-bye.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Ready, Baron.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
We shall see who remains here the longer.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm engaged for the evening.
I'm the stenographer.
Me.
What brown hands you have.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Not too quickly.
What?
Can't you understand me?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Yes.
Baron!
Well, he's a gentleman!
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
All right.
What?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
What?
Preysing, you're joking with us.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
We did not approach you.
He likes to play the great man.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh!
You haven't time.
You're discharged.
Yes, I know them --
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I want to keep my teeth.
Your what?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You expect me to buy this?
You're a thousand percent right!
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Goody!
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Just myself.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Perk, remember?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Get off the grift, Roy.
Well, that's good news.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
For God's sake, Lilly!
No.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
We'll work something out, Joe.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Taking you for granite?
Let's find out.
All? It ain't bad.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I'll see you when you get home.
He retired.
Where?
Upstate where?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
What?
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Only the real stiffs.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
It's an option.
I was trying to get away from someone.
I was trying to protect you from this...
Just get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
You stole it?
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
It's always John.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
What are you looking at?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
The voice man!  He's here!
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
I've come to help your family.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Wait a minute ...
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Hm?
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
No.
Must have changed that law.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
You're an imbecile.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Our pleasure.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I've considered that.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
For Africa.
You're hollow, like a woman.
Thank God!
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Man and boy.
Wow.
Where did you get the poison?
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Penelope!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Nothing.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Sir?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought a doctor might help.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
You're a woman, aren't you?
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
I don't think so.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
Almost a Christmas scene.
I see.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
And her fiancé!
I've literally got to run!
I was going to ask.
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
What for?
There's a certain amount of information there.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
And terror, if you don't mind.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
New lives begin!
What are you going to do?
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
I dunno, boy.
It was a bitch.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
I'm only ten years old.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
How did she lose her feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
For Heaven's sakes!
You're taking Mom out tonight?
He is my father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I see.
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Tonight's the night.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
That's the XKE.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Paul's only twelve years old.
We've got to rescue him.
We met here earlier this evening.
I believe in miracles now.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Or get eaten alive.
He died of a massive rupture.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
But is she, has...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Do you want to take a session?
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
How many weeks?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Nah.
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
Something like that. How much do you make?
They were here?
Why can't I meet him now?
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
What makes you so sure?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
What are you paying me for?
What do you mean?
No.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
But I'm here to help you...
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
A block of ice.
Eh, no.
Harold Chasen.
Oh.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Oh, look! The birds.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Because they are all the same.
What is it?
But what?
Well, I really don't drink...
Superb.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Of course.
Well, don't go.
Well, they're my species.
I took them out.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Oh, Harold. 
For you.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
Mother.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Like a tea ceremony?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Fifteen.
Yes. It does.
You liked your teachers?
Then why did you leave?
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Yes.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Frank.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
No. You look...
Because I'm going to get my father!
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Red, I found something --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
That makes him more than a hundred --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
We're on the move.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Anung-un-Rama...
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Hey. You: think twice --
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Alone?
...Polo.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Kirsty?
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Oh my God.
One more. Maybe two --
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
Not know.
A box?
Who did?
You're still afraid.
So you were cheated.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
I don't.
I said no.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
What's the problem?
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
No, you're not.
Are you O.K.?
What's wrong with you?
Not much.
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No.
Yeah, why don't I?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
Yeah.
Finished?
Gone?
I AM house-trained.
It's late.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
We're not all frigid.
I won't let anybody take you.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Say it.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Well what's the point in that?
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
What do you mean, "what?"
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Terrific.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
We're getting that anyway.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
On Clark Street!
Why?
He's not worth it!
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
What are you talking about?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Fine.  That's great.
Is that it?
I'll tape it for you.
Okay.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
It's Vince and Justin.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
Well stay for tonight, then.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
So you weren't interested in music at all?
And do you like it that way?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
Is that the last of it?
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I guess I am.
Hey, how ya doin'?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
You know the difference.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Would you marry me if I was?
Are you persuadable?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
You called this morning?
How're you holding up?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Well she --
What difference does it make?
Enough of what?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Oh, right.  Alright.
That way.  You?
That way.
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Thanks.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Anything in Maryland is close.
What the hell is going on?
He called you "MacLeod".
You?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're wrong.
You won't.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Just a little crazy.
Now there's a new topic.
Four?
Never take up poker, Detective.
He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
Aye.
Please go to no trouble.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
How can you know this?
Pheasant.
You are still so very young.
It is the truth.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Why?
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Something pretty.
Far away.
It's all we have.
Not likely.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
No.  I want this to be all ours.
How did you find me?
-Since you last saw me.
You're wrong.
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
For the moment.
Do you?
Steven, Conor didn't die.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
We were very close.
I'll send them right up.
No.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Excuse me, I just want to --
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
The poem?... The poem was great!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I'll come a-running, pardner.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Out of the mouths of babes.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
Listen, Walter --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda.
The insurance business?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Now you got me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
What do you mean?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I'd like to think.
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Where's Butch?
Was she? Did you notice?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
So long, Hildy.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
I did.  Hold the wire.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.
Editorials?
I'm telling you!
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
What did you do with her?
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Keep away!
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
They're not human!
You mean here in the city?
No, I don't think so.
But how do I know...?
Pinkus.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Who told you that?
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
OK. You're in.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Pauline.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Half the time he's bluffing.
The ideas you get in your head.
There, there, my baby.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Well, yeah, kind of.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
He left!
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Whoopie fucking doo.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
But if you did.
But suppose for a second you did.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
How much further?
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When?
When you were outside with Bill.
Rise and shine.
Tell me about it.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
She looks like she stinks.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Not yet.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
Please, just a minute.
I ain't got a warrant.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Aw, fuck.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Woof.
Oui.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Oui.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Shh.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Please let me go with you.
No.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Always. Ow.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
You are a therapist, right?
How's it going?
Yes, darling.
Flares?
I love you so much.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
No.
That's great.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unn.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yep.
Do we need words?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Sit down.
Only when I work.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
For me.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Where do I sign?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Where?
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
I got time, Bert.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Get with what?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Now and then. Why, do you?
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
No. I'll take you home.
Give me a drag.
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
No. You?
Would he know?
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Why should I?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
My name is Robert.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Yes.
Do you want to go on?
Yes.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Yes.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Please.
Round back.
That's the Air Force Base.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Let's try.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
You have to leave the White House.
Did it work?
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
College nickname.
He wasn't the President then.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
And I am his.
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
An old man's dream.
You could be more right than you know.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
Yes?
Find something?
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
It's important!
But what are you doing here?
Right.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
What does that mean?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lao She.
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Behind you!
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
You will go to palace there.
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
The old man saw it in a dream.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Somehow I feel safer in here.
A snake!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Maybe...
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
No -- real food.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Don't catch cold.
I am -- it looks horrible!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Not quite.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
Me.
I see...
I just got here.
I just went there for a job.
What for?
Then I'm crazy.
I'll talk to them.
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I'm not leaving until you do.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
We get on a plane.
Use my credit cards.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
You'll be me.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Just get there.
...Just beautiful.
Little late for that.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
The sand.
A girl.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
.
Wait.
What?
I made it work.
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
Don't get too cute.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
What is it?
Oh come on.
No. What will you do.
It wasn't like that.
You have to! Quickly!
I was afraid of that.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Well...?
Where?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
What exactly?
I have been... I think you're right.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
That's nice.
The best part. She'll love it.
Don't give her your name.
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
That crazy guy?
It's just money.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
We insist.
It is to me too.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
Oh.
Oh.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Sir?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
Why do you do it?
They left. I had to go with them.
There's not much to tell.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
You did.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
What'd he steal?
Got to trust someone.
And you?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
You've  been there?
Can you?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Why not, what are you going to do?
Escape.
That's twenty feet high.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I don't know.
Why?
You can't take that.
The experiment. The danger...
Perfectly.
For reading.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
P.J.'s.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Alright, alright.
Sure.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
What about you, you got a crew already?
Catch ya' later.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
What?!
I'm alone on this...
...you fucked me!
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
You okay?
Good.  You have kids?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
No.
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I'll call them, Lowell.
Yeah, great.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
She sued you for back payments of child support?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Most certainly.
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a drug on the body?
Chapter and verse.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Excuse me?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Here's her picture...
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It was a gift from a client.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
No.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Not yet.
I told you. I was hungry.
Well, don't look at mine!
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Absolutely.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Howard is a beautiful person.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Okay Miles.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
No, we're not!
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Hello Marylin.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Please!
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
So. Now what?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
We do have a man for you.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Yes?
My client has ruled that out.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
She always looked out for me.
HA!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
How is she?
Yeah.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
What ten thousand?
You're a peculiar chap.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
South America.
Oh, yes. I heard.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
No, I'll go through with it.
Yes. Peter Warne.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why should she? After all—
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
Yessir. She refuses them all.
We've done that already.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Huh?
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
I never thought of that.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Like this. I have no robe.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Santa Claus?
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
What!
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking—
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Mind your own business.
We don't need forty cars.
What'd you give him for the car?
Come here, you little fool!
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
But can't you wait until morning—
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Huh?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
You!
ain't got a hat—
Zeke.  Git!
Why?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Keep saying what?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
No, I did not.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
No.  Never heard of him.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
You have other information?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
And Oswald?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
And how tall are you?
Uh huh.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I'll call her.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
She wants to make a deal.
She knows it's my case?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Can you do it or not?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
What did they want to know?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Cash poor?
Are you?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
You're not old. You look great.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
I'm old enough to be her father.
I go back to work tomorrow.
You don't actually do it that way?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
Why?
When did you decide?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Did you do it that night?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Who's side are you on?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
You know what we want.
If I'm working, I can help you.
You never asked me if I did or not.
What for?
I'm sure that was the idea.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
There was a guy with Melanie?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
So what happens now?
Uh-uh.
What were you two fighting about?
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
Thanks.
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Managers get ten percent.
What'd you care?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Two months shy of four years.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
Are you serious?
Guess where I am?
I dunno.
C'mon in.
An employee I had to let go.
I follow.
What's your relationship?
She believed you?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
How much it there?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Where you shot her.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
It's in there.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Yeah.
I know that.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Is that what I think it is?
Uh-huh.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
He's around.
Where do you want to go?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
LET GO!
What do you mean?
Don't go.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
But the paper ...
... I've seen them, too.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
How do you know?
What can I tell you?
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
What?
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Jacob Singer.
I didn't want to wake you.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Don't ask.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
The best.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Why you left.
When was the last time I said a word?
They weren't human!
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Are we in Brooklyn?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
Stick with me, kid.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
Please.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
You know who I am.
Who then?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
I don't know.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Push 'em back.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Help me!
Paul Gruneger!
A long time.
Count 'em on one hand.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
I don't know what to do.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Speaking of which, duck!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
I don't know. Nothing.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Thorgan, pull us in.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
My job.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
No you don't!
Med-kit?
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
She needs a little time.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
They'll make it.
NO!
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Crutch?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Then open the doors!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Obviously so.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
I never hear the whistle.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Why?
Who are you?
No, we just checked the beach...
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Think the tide's with us?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Cool.
Or something.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Um, hi?
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
What?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
What a trip, man.
No... I guess not.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Oh, go fly a kite.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
I don't know.
No?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
But you're old!
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Room with a toilet, got it.
This is the baby. Your baby.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, no!
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Unfortunately, yes.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
It was magnificent, man!
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
What?
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
Keith's hot.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
And I disagree.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Looks like it, yeah.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Early, you are so sweet.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Now why is that?
Yeah?
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Funny, very funny.
Up yours.
Carrie.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Nervous?
Shut your mouth.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Yes. Altogether.
Yes.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Are you hungry?
What for? That guys a dick.
He lives on 76th?
It is right.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Who?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Good luck?
Yeah. Do it again.
Is it cold?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Yes.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Yeah.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
You didn't?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Who, Benny's little sister?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Yep.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
No.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Maybe you should.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
What are you talking about?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Why her?
Then call them!
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
You like to brag, don't you?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
What word did you leave last night?
The police haven't told you?
By that time the game will be over.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
The pipes.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Boys.
Nice meeting you.
For what?
How long has she been dead?
What do you think he did?
But we heard him.
What did he mean by Huxley?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
The most logical choice.
Ten days ago.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
No you didn't.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead now.
This isn't a game.
How can you look at it so clinically?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
No.
You.
What's wrong?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
You really haven't seen my best side.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Why not?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<u>What</u>?
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Colwyn ...
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Yes.
The Fortress moves?
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Never.
Yes.
She can see the Beast!
I forbid you!
Yes.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot betray my bride.
I cannot.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I was hoping I might be your friend.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
I'm all right.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We'll meet you at the inn.
A small house.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Hush!
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Many have perished in that maze.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No.
Yes.
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Perfect.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
When I say I love you.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Yeah, what?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.
No... Dino's.
I have new dreams now.
Maybe later.
How serious is it?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
You don't think I love you?
Don't be so sure.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Not our problem.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
Yeah!
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Who's telling this story?
Tomorrow.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
I do.
Don't do this.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
No alcohol?
Water?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I sometimes fade out.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
OK... whatever.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Oh, and what did you do?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I don't understand any of that.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
I am lonely, Yuri.
How?
I believe you! Don't worry.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Aristotle.
I don't know.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
You guys are so sweet!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Your scrunchie?
No way --
I will...
Not yet.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
You're serious?
Projecting joy is not my job.
For a butt-head? Yes.
So Friday at eight?
Are you sure?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
What, like it's that hard?
Uh -- sure.
Do anything exciting?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Thank you.
Chuck.
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Yeah, luckily.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
We go out, smash 'em now?
Your love.
I'd soon die.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Don't you know?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Stealing his arms?
Certainly understandable.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
There aren't enough arrows.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
What weapon?
Sunlight.
I could have struck off his head just now!
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Where?
And did you?
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
But you did... you did!
Or perchance...
Sport, indeed.
Stop complaining.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Jack... Forgive me...
They told me you were dead.
In the dark... where I join him...
Thought the weather terrible of late.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
I don't believe you.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
That was in jest.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
We can work.
Since seventh grade.
Oh.
What color?
Uh...using Josh like that.
No.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Where's your dad?
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
I don't wanna go.
A violation?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Yes, it is.
Oh...okay.
We're getting out of the ground today.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You can't make me do a thing.
No.
I like how it feels not to feel.
How do you become something you're not?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Why wouldn't she leave?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
You lied to me!
I'd build a house.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Four days.  I left to think.
I was parked in day parking.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Going on?
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
No.
Who?
You can't go because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I never asked for more.
I feel in love with George again.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Why?
Okay.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Nagger?
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
She's doing just fine.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
But you can't.
Married?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Yes, boss.
Sure, boss.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
But I'm having a good time...
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Why didn't you take it?
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
A loan officer?
That's right, a loan officer.
You need collateral.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
You know what I'm saying.
You still got that map?
Does that mean I'm in?
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
I'm stuck!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You get ketchup?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
That was five years ago.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
You ever done time before?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Movin' it out, boss.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
What are you in for, Willie?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
They run but they never get too far.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?
You shouldn't have come here.
What do you think about... Earth?
Urr... uggg... errr...
Try an angel.
It would be so okay.
You're already there...
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
That pain is hunger.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
You did it for Namath.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Beast.
What was it called, sir.
We know where to find Nicky.
I'll just go to Heaven.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
If you want to.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
You have a dog? What kind?
What was that?
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Are you dead?
No.
What are you doing?
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I love you.
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
That's better.  How do you want us?
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
Sad? What made you sad?
I thought I had to do something.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
It's different now. Help me.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Some people say children need human mothering.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
He's good, isn't he?
They won't believe us.
It's the only way.
Don't ever let go.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
I don't know.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
At least it's over...
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
For as long as I can remember.
Are there any other humans?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
All right.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Right... This just glided along.
Over there.
Okay...
Sure.
Are you positive he knows?
I used to.
What's he do?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Andy?
Okay.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Dick Laurent?
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Did you tell the police this?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
When he went to work, right.
Coming up.
My... My head.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
That's absurd.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
Who's it from?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
But...
He's got some fucked up friends.
Which would you choose?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Yeah.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
I don't know.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Sure. Sure I do.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Go home, Sheila.
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
I'm a paleontologist.
A paleontologist.
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
I see.
Will you stop squawking!
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
The police?
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
No.
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Oh, good heavens, no!
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Then it's done.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Yes.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
Dead?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Porters?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
You're wrong, George.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
was saying—
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
That was easy. I read your books.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
We're the government, Cowan.
Mrs. Edelson?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Yup.  Sure is.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
She didn't even know you. .
Ha ha.  No, really.
Why?
Um-- Kay?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
in case I need it?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
You figured what?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Come on now.  People are smart.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
May I have a look?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Wait-- listen--
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Can you see?
Is it now?
Because I found out about her...
Anne Lively...
Whatever you say, John.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Try again.
The nation votes this week...
Tuck in your shirt.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Everybody runs.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Sir?
We're in motion on something.
Take your time.
If it's a question of authority.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
So now I need you to hack into her.
They don't belong to anybody.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Wanna hear something funny?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
Hold your breath, Dad...
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
You're insane or you think I am.
The female.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I don't know who that is.
I'll be right there.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
What kind of cop were you before this?
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
You mean after he lost your son.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Tell me how all this works.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Jesus...
Yeah.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Is it the good room?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
We're in Fashion.
So you're models?
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Bullshit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Mommy's not home?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Max offered to stake me.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
I want you to take her with you.
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah?
Where's Ricky.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yes. Goodbye.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Where's the drop?
You don't know where you're going?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
He's not here.
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I got no idea.
Ask if he said anything to her.
Bye.
I thought you hate that club.
We don't need guns.
He didn't say we need guns.
Fuck him.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Is that the woman from..?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Oh really. Why's that?
Fuck...
So they said more than the address.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You would think.
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fine.
We're not getting whacked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
So what do we do?
I'll be a minute.
Bobby and Ricky.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
No?
Here...
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
And where do we bring it?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Lemme write it down for you.
Why?
You owe me six big ones.
Now.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Don't con me.
What do you do with your time?
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I don't know how.
I want to. God knows I want to.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
You have enough worries of your own.
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
How old are you, Betty?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Just hold me.
You're with me even when you're away.
Talk about what?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Is my family here yet?
The sentences to run concurrently.
I do know I love you.
Your control over your children, therefore --
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
What does Sidney say?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Me?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Shorty, this is Laura.
The hell you are.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
He told you that?
Yes sir.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
They talked about me like
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
So you are going to talk me to death.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[The what?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
I came to visit you.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
The United States.
No.
I'm looking for potential.
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
You feel sorry for the husband?
Yeah. Two or three.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
I'm fine.
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
I think it's fantastic.
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
So am I.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
What was she to Creasy then?
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Which one was that?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
We just talked.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Your son Marty?
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
No...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Goodnight.
I'm stag.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
You gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Ma! Leave me alone!
Hey, Ang'...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Hello, Thomas.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Just one for a start.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Perfectionist.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
When?
Be right with you.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
A football game?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
What?
You betcher ass, General.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
Oh, Jesus.
Hang in there.
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
Second pint.
I didn't have much choice.
Thanks.
The one and only.
What's wrong with him?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Morning, Captain.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Arterial silk.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
No.
About me?
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Oh.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
What's that?
The letter from John Doe.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
A deal?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Duets? But can we trust him?
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Huh? Get what?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
No, I didn't write it, but—
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Flowers.
She isn't?
Oh!
Good night, John.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
I didn't see anything.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
I don't know.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Of course.
Clarence Teal.
What happened, Mike.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Huh?
Am I gettin' the car?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Is that all?
Spread it out.
I know.
Is there something wrong with that?
I don't really like to drink.
We see each other every couple of months.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
I do.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Stay put.
Only that floor.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You think I didn't need you?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Just now.
Scottie...
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
I'll provide you with transportation.
What have you promised them?
Okay...
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
True.  But why?
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Unfinished business.
It's his nature.
The woman you're stuck on.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Go!
To hide the evidence.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
-- The inside?
Way you kiss me.
Because you'll never believe me.
Describe program function.
Checking connection.
-- Waiter.
-- Standard.
Scanning body type.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Yeah, right.
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
GO POWER RANGERS!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
So what happened?
And now you have everything.
What do you mean?
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Long as Charlie says.
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Have you thought about this?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I been thinkin'...
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
We learn from life.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Come on. Be polite.
Luciano is dead?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Now that's a hard number.
This is nice. I mean it.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Stu Miley.
<u>Why</u>??
Well - you'd need a body.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Why?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
And you don't deal drugs?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
... What are they all doing there?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
What pictures?
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
You mean it's dangerous?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What do I play?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
What dame?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
And to Don Quixote!
Yeah. Funny--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Again? Good idea.
I'll cherish ya.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Well, let's get going.
Where?
What?
Right now--everything I own--!
You know, we're getting married.
Why me?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
How do you feel, champ?
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Mr. President!
For one week!
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Mr. President--
Yes, Ma?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Right.
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
*This* is.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Go right ahead.
Why?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Letitia.
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
A camp! Well!
How are the pigeons?
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
"So help me God."
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
How's that, buddy?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
A Bill! Not *him*!
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
I know that.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
He's lost complete faith in me--
He did it.
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
What do you think?
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Any children?
No, no children.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Would you like to go for a walk?
Were you present when all these things took place?
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Really?
Oh, I don't mind.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
What did they say?
Yes.
He did? I play the tuba—
No, I don't mind.
Mary - I - excuse me—
Don't be ridiculous.
People have been crucified before.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Right.
Shhh!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Come on - let's go!
I wish you luck, sir.
We'll send for the police!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Where?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Huh?
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
We own an opera house, don't we?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Naturally.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Why not?
Uh-huh.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Now wait a minute, buddy—
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
But she's on the telephone—
What, sir?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
What happened?
Uh-huh.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
What's that?
I think he's got a point.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Stop now.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
What exactly is it supposed to do?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
What do you want to know?
...so accomplished.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Can you help Mom?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Oh... not a real doctor.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
What would you do?
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Is she against you getting help?
What?
No.
Uh-huh.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Disgusting.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Either one.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I think so.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference!
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What is your name?
Will you be here?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Where was this?
Have women found you attractive?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Was it something that happened at school?
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
I've got three big ones.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
Amazing.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
What about everything? How did this happen?
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
What'd I do?
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Yes, yes it does...
Yep.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
That's one way of putting it.
Yeah! Them.
Exactly --
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
You will not believe it.
Really want to know?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Trust me.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Who was talking about what?
Something like that.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
That just makes you more gullible.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
But you're a superhero.
What did he mean?
Sure.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Against.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
It is?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Who wouldn't?
Yeah.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And what if you get killed?
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
Yeah.
But look at him... and look at us.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Who's chicken? 
Well they've crawled back out.
Come on.
Yes.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Mother... it's not what you think!
But... the silverware?
It is?
Definitely.
This looks like a job for Superman --
The who?
Right.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
Proceed.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
What do you mean?
I did, sir.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
But who made this treaty?
It is a terrible shock.
Bertrand, sire.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
A glass of champagne, please.
Bastia -- and you?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You must not act impetuously.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Of course.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
What are you talking about?
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
What I am talking about is moderation.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Thanks, Unc.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
I'm his cousin.
I'll do it.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
You don't know Baby D.
You walked?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
I saw it.
Come on.
Nice to meet you?
Why did he go in the house?
And some rolling papers.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
What?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
You were very nervous.
For not believing you.
That's right. That gives you...
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
All right.
Please. Something is going to happen...
That's right.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
Help me get her off the rug.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
They hid in a broom closet!
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Mister Powell!
Satan.
How?
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
She talks to herself.
Dead.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Is that all?
Nothin'!
What?
Come to me, boy!
Now it's your turn.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Can I have my supper please?
No.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
O' course.
Our honeymoon.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
The Lord will provide.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
The Drugstore?
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Well what you reading it for?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Krueger?
Like Rod Lane?
I will.
Mother, for petesakes.
Great
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Or we can't go back to Russia!
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
What is it?
How many families live here with you?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
No, that's bad management.
Shall we tell her?
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Count d'Algout...
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
What is it, my boy?
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Comrade.
Just looking around.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
We did our best, Comrade.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Private.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Thank you.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
And what do you do for mankind?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You repeat yourself.
The telephone is ringing.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Because we are an odd couple.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Do you like Scotch stories?
I wish they had never met.
I don't think so.
Yes.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
And General Savitzky.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
You haven't seen her yet?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Yes, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
I must ask you to leave.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Madame, if you...
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Unfortunately.
Please... sit down.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Yeah?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
I don't have a pistol.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
Money.  Follow the money.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Run 'em over.
It's the parents' fault really.
I believe you're right, boss.
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
What about the documents he promised?
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What ... ?
Yes ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Mr. Castro.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
I never met the man.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
Of course.
Did you cry when he died?
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
That'll be the day.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
Elvis I like, too.
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Yes, yes.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Amen to that.
I'll concede in the morning.
Not that.  Us.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Is that the truth?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then I'll be there for you.
Anything.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
They're all your enemies?
Hiding what?
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Didn't know there was any.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
No ID in her room?
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Well what would you call him.
He's real all right.
Oh yes.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
He won't neither. He never has.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Mm.
I don't know...
I'm hidin' behind you.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
Hyah!
Okay.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well I didn't see it.
I wouldn't worry about it.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
No. I found it.
What? Quit hollerin'.
I need to know that.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
I can hear it in your voice.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
You from around here?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
I see.
Sixty-nine cent.
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Sir?
Well...
I could come back then.
For what?
Everything.
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
I want you to take me to another motel.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
I'm sorry.
No, one forty-two.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
How would you describe him?
Not that way.
You do, I reckon.
I don't know.
I got an overcoat on.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Any idea where it is?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Oh, this is wonderful...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I better go check on them.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I gotta go.
We were engaged.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
You told me that two hours ago.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Yes... maybe it was.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
George...
Thanks...
I got you, Del...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
It was Chloe...
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Really?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Man, that is love.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Doctor David Ravell.
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Huh?
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Really. And where was that, old man?
Ahh... my wife's.
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Of what?
Hell of a way to die.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
It is, if you like idiots...
We know that...
I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it.
What the hell's going on?
Uh-huh.
Would you say she was ambitious?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Did Chloe crack?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Her show?
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Where's Tommy?
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Okay, Everett.
He was never turned into a frog!
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Pullin' ah pants down...
That's good, honey.
- in the gods - Huh?
Not your...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You said -
That wasn't my doing...
So I borrowed it till I did know!
But... but...
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
I am. Hur you?
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Great ass.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
I called you Sarge.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
You what?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
You hope.
And you turned him down??
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
That's okay. I'm used to it.
What would you do differently?
So?
Why'd he do it?
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
I have the gun.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Can we come in?
What do you want?
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
No ball, kid.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
No fucking way.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
The hell we are.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
What?!
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Fuck.
Give me a break.
"Titanic."
Come on, come on...
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
I was trying not to tell you...
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
You know it. Stay Black...
Look this is bull...
You got it. Berkeley?
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Maybe...
If you got something to say, say it.
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Shut the fuck up!!
Yeah... cop hit me...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
No.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
I know that.
Apology accepted.
As you wish.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
What officers?
And if I triumph, you triumph.
I understand, sir.
He tried.  It didn't take.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She is.  Don't go in there.
And what do they know?
That's right.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Thank you.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
To remember.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What were you listening to?
Sure.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Because it's right.
Yes.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Shit! Look at this mess!
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I just said--
That's forgotten.
I'm sure.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
He didn't waste it.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
The situation has changed.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
Very well.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
I can't breathe.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
I know the code.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
The trees are taller.
Yes, the rum is gone.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
We're catching up!
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
How did he get off the island?
We're not going to just surrender!
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Sorry, I didn't know.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Only a little.
Somewhat.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye!  Avast!
Is that so?
I'll lead them away.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
... no.
Speak.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
No, Icky, this is real.
Consideration?
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Donated to science.  Perfect.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
A man?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
The big house.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
Right.  You predicted it.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Daniel!
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Like a glove.
You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Goodbye, Stew—
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
How-di-do.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Gallagher?
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I knew your managing editor very well.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
With me you can always do business.
Right - for the first time this year.
Why not?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Thanks. May I sit down?
She did—?
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
It's all right. Bring him in.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
All right, Grandma—
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
I just putter.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
I'm fine.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Bud?
No she's not.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
All night?
Sure you are.
Really Biff? The keenest?
I don't believe it.
She won't go out with me?
Okay, that's IT!!!
Rain.
What is it?
I thought the books were blank?
To who?
What?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
What were you doing in a library?
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
That's great.
Yeah ...
You don't know?
What?
What's that like?
They just grow like that?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
Sure ...
No I won't. I swear.
McGinty's.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Well c'mere, young fella.
What?
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Oh no? Let me show you something!
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Cool.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Did I say that?
I don't know.
I have work, I can't leave.
I don't know.
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Are your pants off?
Really?
You have a girlfriend?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Yes.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
I know I did. But I don't.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
....this is your mistake....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah, not really.
I saw a picture of you.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Really?
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
No, no. I did.
Yeah.
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Did you pick it up from the street?
...yeah...
Lena?
Yes.
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Yeah......yeah.....
That's right you travel so much.
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Did you do it?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
Hello, how are you?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
I'm sorry.
You ok?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Let's just leave it there for now.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
That's funny.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes.
What is this, man?
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Put him through.
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Once or twice.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
AND DID YOU?
Go to hell!
Of course.
Yes?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Most assuredly.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pray you: be succinct.
I am not a wealthy woman.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
-- words alone are insufficient.
And I in yours.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Forgive me, I beg you --
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Last week would this be?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
I wonder sometimes.
And he did.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
You know that can't happen.
There's nothing to explain
I will not defend my life to you--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
No -- no -- I mean--
He personally asked you to?
Telling stories.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Not for me.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
The old man has his own way of doing things
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
It doesn't have to be
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
And what does he see?
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
But it's not a great syllable
I just can't . . see it anymore
I'm sorry.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Christ.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Kinda.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
CITIZEN KANE
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Ah, it's a grand title.
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
It was fun, wasn't it?
We done?
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Here's your glove.
With her? How?
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Well, I heard some things.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
What?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Does that mean...
Yeah. At night.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Go 'head. Do it.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Yeah.
All I did...
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
Name me a better photographer.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Namely?
You think I made all this up?
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
You think he's getting out of here?
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
That depends on who "they" were.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Where'd they take Lisa?
You did.
I'll send you some comic books.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Yeah.
Well, I only quote from the best.
It crashed, didn't it?
I don't want to.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Mrs. Doyle?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Of course not.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Do you think I consider this recreation?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
How?
Shut up. I'm all right.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
I like you, you know?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
Any other entrance?
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Shoot, Jimbo.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
You what?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
You don't?
I think I know my son.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Head-shrinker?
What?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
What's a chickie-run?
I hitched.
Who has?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
It's me!
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
When was that?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
You sure?
Just a guard.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Mess that kid up?
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Hi.
Are you?
You disappointed?
You smell like baby powder.
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
What's he like?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
What?
Daddy--
Hi.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
I've been doing good, though.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Yeah.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
What.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
They're truck drivers.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You saved me.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You said it a million times!
She says a lot of things.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
Samantha.
What'd they call her in high school?
Her brother.
Christmas... Eve...
I said, who the hell made the map?
Why not.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
More than you know.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
At least gimme video poker.
You need six.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Ash?
Leave the tree.
And where they hide the real money.
Mr. Bangs.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
My what?!
Hell you haven't.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Good for you. Protein.
...be with her...
NICK!!!
That was my king!
Well...sorry...
Yes.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Bullshit.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
Did the two of you talk?
The Brewers.
What for?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
How is he?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Lie back down, and try to -
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I don't believe in it.
What's wrong with it?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Nope.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
You can stay here if you like.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
All right -- it's said!
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
A little hot.
A man I used to know.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
Nice.
Yes.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
There's only two of them now.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
I said I didn't care.
There aren't any women here.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
They shouldn't have done that.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Maybe in Sonora.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
What's the use.
Who brought you here?
Put on another one.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
No. We're not stayin' --
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Sure.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I think he wants me.
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
That's it.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
You sure?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Alright!
Yes...
No. Keep rubbing.
Listen to me I --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
Hot dogs.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Hey, I got an idea.
I wouldn't go that far.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Professor!
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Because she will lie?
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Why?
Because it's the rules!
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
She sure can pick 'em!
But Mom, the video's not over.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
I'm so happy I could shit.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
You mean for TV or print?
Bird books mostly...
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
That's nice.
Oooohhhh.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
...People who don't mind their own business.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Yes, I was.
We all have bad nights. 
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
You got your wish.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Right here!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Bon Appetit!
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
How to send a bill!!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
You can?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
You can't tell.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
And that was all?
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I don't know.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
It's here, too.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
Cloven hoof?
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
Unless what?
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
Why
Yes?
Oh.
Oh, uh-huh.
No, not really.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
How do you mean?
Impotent.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Who's Donna?
You just ask them questions?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Yes.
How did you know?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
Yes.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
I'm not planning on it.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
No.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I'm not either!!
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I know.
What?
Yes.
Not very often.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
No, I haven't.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I say it because it's descriptive.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
But he won't.
Will you stop? Jesus.
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I don't want to talk about it.
Questions about sex.
Why?
You couldn't do it, period.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
It does not.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
She still is.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
What did he say?
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
Is that what he tells you?
No? Not even one more?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Who said I was jealous?
Afraid of getting caught?
I'm intrigued.
You're intrigued?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
What's so stupid about it?
Right.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I just... Ann is very...
Who?
It'll just be me.
Not for three-fifty.
You were prying before?
What do you mean?
He said immediately.
All right, jesus.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Sure.
Yes.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
I see. Then what brought you up here?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Do I get a kiss?
No. I don't think so.
OK. But late.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
...closed?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it, Ralph!
You too, Betty!
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOUNG BLOOD
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
Surely.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
You guys having fun?
Bye.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Huh.
What are you pouring tonight?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah.
Just tell me.
And?
Oh yeah. Much better.
What?
That's your problem, Miles.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Want some?
Just a minute!
It's not even a mile.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Uh-huh.
If that's what feels right.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
What do you think?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Yeah. Okay.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Nope.
Oh yeah. Sure.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
What's happening?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Me?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
I'll pay for it.
You need a new car anyway.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Why don't you come in?
Back at you.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Sure.
Hey.
What's the title?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Well...
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, Maya. No.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
See you over there, Miles.
Good stuff.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
No.
A hair.
Hi baby.
...Tell Graham --
I see.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Are you going to do this or what?
That's right.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
It's getting stronger.
Edgar, come inside.
Oh.
Where are we going to sleep?
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
I would say so.
Why not?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
It's like War of the Worlds.
They'll find a way in.
...And you had to kill him?
What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
And you're not Baxter, either?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
And they were two of them. Look --
You got no idea what they were after?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
What happened?
Who?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
And a pretty lady.
Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Right!
What now?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
Because they enjoy it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Here he comes right now.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
I'm ready for that.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
Who?
I'm not --  He's not.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
If it's on the page...
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
That's true.
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
I want you back too, Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
And what may I ask brought this on?
For her?
Absolutely not!
There's... a wall between you --
How did the wall get there?
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
She still with Kent?
She can't watch herself.
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
Precisely.
I noticed.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
This is the story.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
This should take care of Mother.
Dark?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Good.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
The only real truth is in the work.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
You're a doctor. What kind?
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
You hate him?
What kind of words?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Your eyes told me.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Cats?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
They want me to do things for them.
Who!
Chuck E. who?
You're standing in horseshit.
Fuck you.
Which street corner?
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Sounds familiar.
Book of Jeremiah.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
He's right. Nice guitar break.
This is his room... isn't it?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
I --
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Yes!
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Is that right?
Mmmm -- so can I...
Wait a minute --
Spider.
No. What…?
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
What?
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
It's just a work thing.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Having fun.
Driving?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
He's after us again!
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
Weight Station.
Well, thanks for the lift.
Absolutely.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Another time.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Do I have a choice?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Yes, ma'am.
That's the point, Dickey.
Yes, sir.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Yeah.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Uh, yeah.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Damn... alright then.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Then what --
I said I got his machine.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
I'm working on it.
Got hit twice.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
What were you doin' here anyway?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
A Fed? Like FBI?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
...What are they doin' right now...?
What else did Padiche say?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Why would you let her to do that?
How?
I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How long can you go without sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Maybe you can.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
To calm my anxiety.
I want you inside me right now.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
It's all right.
Thank you.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
No, Ma'am.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Hmm...
Yeah, what a woman.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Tell it like it is.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I don't know.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I'll think about Wednesday.
You don't have to, now.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
You heard me.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
You in this with me?
I asked for the man in charge...
I'm not lettin' no one go.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
Be nice.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
I know.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Harry!
I know.  I've got one too.
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Yeah--
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
What's this? A cockaroach?
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
I don't think he wants me to find him.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
You should write that one down.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
How is he?
I don't care.  Cretin.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
No…
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
Right.  Let's go.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Any news on Dunbar?
Static!
Who is it?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Forget it.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Sefton!
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Jawohl?
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
Where'd that come from?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Bombs away!
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Anything else?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Good.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
You off your rocker?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
December seventh, forty-one.
What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Give me the radio.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
When is it expected back?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Really? What do you feel?
You get what?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
One minute to warp core breach.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Please, please.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Where are the deflector relays?
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Response?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
... Fascinating.
A photon tube...!
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
My readings indicate great instability.
I have already made one transmission too many...
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
What's wrong?
Goodbye, David.
... A cloaking device?
Come on!
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
What must I do?
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
They know we would die first.
They outnumber us, my Lord --

Sir, may I --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
All true.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
From yourself, Admiral.
... taking Genesis away from us...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Who --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
It was just words.
I am truly sorry.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
A few shots, sir.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Spock...!
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
I did not think so.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Aye, sir.
Course heading, Captain?
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
By the book...
You do this -- for friendship?
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
What do you mean?
We've done it before.
That's crazy!
Come on, Pavel...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
All right. Let's take it from the top.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
It's his way.
Implicitly.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Noon tomorrow...?!
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Why does it have to be goodbye?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
In progress, Admiral.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Explain.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Right.  Will you help us?
Weapons systems?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Full power, sir.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
I am well, Admiral.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Do you have the right to murder?
Well, that's different.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
Sulu Hikaru.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
For someone so young.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Do machines ever play?
Won't he rust?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Understood.
A planet in Federation space...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
May I talk to you alone?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
We're trying to get to you, sir...
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."
Transferring controls to manual.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Can you beam him off?
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Why was Data assigned?
But it's comfortable.
... I believe you...
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
Bag him.
Can you configure it?
Do it.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Where?
Always am.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
<U>Engage.</U>
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Ready.
Yes.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We?
Friends from Cornell...
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
On screen.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
I'll keep that in mind.
Understood!
What kind of message?
Admiral Donald...Bill...
I wish I knew. Uhura?
We've been set up all along.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
I didn't mean this future.
Specifically of...?
Still think we're finished?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
To be -
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Yes.
Uhura, monitor!
ALL uniforms?
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Aye, sir.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Captain.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Where?
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
Spock, you want to know something?
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
WE SURRENDER.
What's left of it.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
You are me.
I am in a room with lights.
No.
Why?
Why?
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
He turned out all right.
That was another time.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Yes.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
This isn't about me anymore.
Thank you, Commander.
What do we know about the population?

Aye, sir
Aye, sir.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
It's working.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
We can only hope so.
You know I do.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Looking up at the stars.
New worlds.
Why am I here?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
It’s too late.
Yes, Praetor.
A matter of hours now.
They will obey, Praetor.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
I have a purpose.

And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
How much are your rooms?
We should have. Let me see.
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Shermin...
What?
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Watch it. They're coming out.
Pancakes.
Money.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
This car runs on gas.
Gas good?
Space?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
I...
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Why?
What is hitchhike?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
He will.
Are you my friend?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I do not get cold.
You don't forget anything, do you?
I understand.
I know how to gamble now.
Hey buddy... let her go...
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
In the cars, too?!
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
No, sir. Radar.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
No problem.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Make me forget it, baby.
Tonight.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
What a nightmare.
That's right.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
What?  Right Here?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Why me?
W'sup, Max?
What stuff?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
What?
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Define illegal.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Get it.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
She's my destiny.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Never really thought about it.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
No.  Trust me.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
No.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
I'm on my way.
Let's take a look.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
Yes.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Maybe cause he's smart.
I'm hesitant to...
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Not especially.
They're all criminals?
What's that?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
I've been thinking about this.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
I don't carry it with me.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
[Follow me.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
Shut up.
I'm sorry?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
I'd say about two weeks.
Like the quiche?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
No.
...Four days..?
Sorry?
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah.
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Right.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
Well, that's dumb.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
Sure.
Make someone bleed.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
VEGAS.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Always, baby.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
I know. I know.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She was hot.
She thought you were money.
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That was different.
He drives a carriage.
Aww... He got away?
She didn't notice.
No, baby!
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
No.
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
I ask for Justice.
But your daughter is still alive.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
What percentages for my family?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Accept what's happened, Michael.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
What else do you believe in?
That's for you to find out.
Okay.  One minute.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
They're talking to themselves.
You really want to know?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
How do you do.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Just you.
What time do they expect us?
Michael...
He'll be OK.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Goodbye.
You just stand here one minute...
How can you be sure?
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Maybe.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming. 
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Is that good?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
What? What's this?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
I have to go to Venice.
And Rome.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
I didn't mean with you in it.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
What club?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Oh God, I don't think so.
I love Marge.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
I'm well, thank you.
Yes it is.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Frances?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
How long's he staying for?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Shut up! Shut up!
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Oh Marge.
No glasses.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
How did you know that?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I know.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Ten thirty?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
He says so many fiancées.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
It's okay.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Why lie?
What about Thomas Ripley?
I don't remember the exact date.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Absolutely.
They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in? 
Nah. I ain't interested.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
The moon?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I bought a couple of tickets.
I mean porno movies.
My God!
Keep it.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Show me how he did that again.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Where is home?
Pittsburgh.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
There must be something...
There's porno theatres for that.
Education?
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Your name Sport?
Like do anything, you know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
The cell, Mason.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
I did?  Huh!
How'd they get it inside?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Yeah...
I'm  fine.  Really.  
What?
That's... pretty frightening.
Yes, sir.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Shhhhhh.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Why?
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
... Ernie.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Oh, no, I...
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sandra Sinclair.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
We live in a theater?
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
What's his rent?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Luke didn't smoke.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Cat.
It's about me.
Oh.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
I already have.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
It's a lovely garden.
Yes.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes.
Would you like some brandy?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
Then go.
Yes?
Just a little one.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Why are they trying to kill people?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
Where would I get a boat?
Of course.
What name?
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
Oh, thank you.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
And locked it.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Monday?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Oh.
The sign says strawberry finches.
But how... how do you know my name?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What are you? A policeman?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
We... we went to school together. College.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
What do you want ?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I have several jobs.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
So they united.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
It was like that yesterday.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
Don't let's take any chances.
What time is it?
How about you?
Wait here. Don't move.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Do you have any lovebirds?
How soon?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I remember her.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Well --
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I have other means of sustenance.
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
No great lady will ever take my place?
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
Good thing in a situation like this.
How can you die if you're already dead?
No! Why are you haunting me?
No...
No. You don't.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
I know.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
What did I say?
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
You know about the United Nations?
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Well, we could--
You ready?
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Come on in.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
I feel different right now.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Goodnight, my dear.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Where is the meeting going to be?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
No. That's all finished.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Would you like to sell it?
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
This one could save your life.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
Honda 250, huh?
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Hit the lights again.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Okay.
Smells like something died.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
He's already gone to bed.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Me, too.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Don't turn on the light.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Now who'd go and do...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Gee, thanks!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
You been made, MacReady.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Well, get to it.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
Position, my ass...
So what do you make of it?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
What?!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
On the towers?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
What happened?
No...
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
Around here.
Morlocks --
Do you know where they live?
How have you survived so long?
Send him away.
Yes.
Oh, shut up.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Do you know which way?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
Created?
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
You took her because she helped me.
I just love mechanical things.
Why is it -- breaking up?
Talk away, Professor.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Dance with me...
Trust me...
I need... to talk to you.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Where's the challenge in that?
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
What?
I'm sorry, David.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
His home.
Sir...?
Yes...
He's gone to a better place.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --
How long ago?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Did you have fires at night?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... I suppose so.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Here?
May I get you some --
Exactly correct, sir.
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Kalen...
Should we be...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
That's too bad.
How...how are you here?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
They should just be looking harder.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Oh, yeah.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
How'd he die?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
[Beat] I don't know.
No, he didn't.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I could try to...make it stop.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Maybe.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
What for?
I do believe you...
What are you talking about?
Good.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Sure.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
[Beat] Thanks.
I'm not sure.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
You like it?
[Beat] Why?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Uh-huh.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
Go fuck yourself.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
What?
Who's your friend?
Maybe.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Why now, Jimmy?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car!
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Yes.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I don't know.  I won't be.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
What happened?
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Before.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Whatever.
Pass him!
What?
What?!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You got that right.
So you admit it?
You sent that?
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Good-looking?
Well once. Mary.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Well why don't you look her up?
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Yeah feels like it.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
I don't know what to say.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Hm?
Jesus Christ you're right.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
No I can't.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Yep.
No thanks.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Same here again.
-- He's in a cage?!
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Warren!
Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You want her dead, don't you?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
No, not at all.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Jai alai?
Surprised?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Friend. Baseball bat.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Why you son of a --
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I'd go with the seven.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
He's dead.
We've got a lot in common.
Trying to be.
Toy poodle!
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
You forgot your keys!
You got what stuck?
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Where the hell are you?
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
Then you'll call, right?
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
Then they should speak up.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
An invasion...
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
What's happened?
I want an hour with him.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
That may be what they want us to think.
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't get too attached.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
It ain't Geronimo.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Goodbye.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
She's that subtle?
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Cuz I want New York.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Let the press through.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
You've got no jurisdiction.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Come back?
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
How so?
You saw a MiG 21?
Where were you?
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Harmless!
Make what?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Why?
I'm still second best.
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
What do you want?
Yesterday.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Your watch.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
He's pissing me off!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
You're crazy. We're level.
No! Now we're inverted!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Is it you?
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
No shit. The Iceman....
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
What?
I can't eject.
SHIT!!
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Yes sir.
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
No bother.
I called your house.
I know.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
You're getting off to an early start.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
But maybe you can change all that.
Who are you?
Would you like the same suite?
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
We haven't implanted it yet.
Come on...put his head in place.
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Any news of Quaid?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Oh, Rekall.
No shit...
I did?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Up!
Come on!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
I don't know.
Tell me!
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
What's he talking about?
I think it's still hungry.
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Get out!
Like what?
I gave you?
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
Some kind of mutation...?
Roger that.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Well, sure.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
You're hung up again.
A man who plans ahead.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
I'm gonna help you.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Around here?  Why would they?
An hour after you picked it up!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And one good guy.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
What about entrapment?
I can describe it.
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
-- an angel dust dealer --
We're taking the other case.
What other case?
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
That's why I hate experts.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
I've seen this picture before.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
EXACTLY!
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That's right.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
I want you to kill for me.
What was?
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Okay, Gordon!!!
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
That would indicate that it's the future.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Thanks.
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
She's wearing a ring.
Faulty wiring.
When?
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Call me.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
No, you should forget about last night.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Who would do that?
But Bob isn't real.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
We're on our way, Baby.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
What's going on?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
Hiking?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom... what are you wearing?
It's a school night... back by nine.
Fine.
Not really.
A special friend?
No.
Yes.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Yes.
How good's your intelligence?
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
We thought it was just.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
I thought I would need it.
Through, through his book.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
I was her doctor.
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...We did everything we could...
Yes!
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
There's nothing they can do to me.
I... um...
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Yes.
Right. Who called?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I understand.
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Overruled...
Still looking.
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
I... do you want me to leave?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
Yes. Price...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
It's locked.
Yes. Yes, I have.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
Thanks, Franky.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
The 'History'...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
In New York?
Yes, the roving nurse...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
We'd be in all the papers!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
It's gone now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Don't let's lose each other.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
It was nearer than that.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Welcome to California!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
He's very excited about it.
Can I read it?
Sort of a trial balloon.
Diabetes?
Home, that's right.
Coming for you...
Read me some?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
I just can't.
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Captured?  How?
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Not yet.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Well, that's all part of it.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
You're not a moron.
Figured what out?
I feel like... we can do anything.
He does.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
Shut up, Phil.
I know you will.
I just brought you something to eat.
Ya know... "It".
I can't make it out?
It was my fault.  I slipped.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
Yes sir.
She's Cuban.
Why would you do that?
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
Shut up donut.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I figured it out.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
Outer.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
Long enough.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Son of a bitch!!
Sir.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Then keep your mouth shut.
I'm not staying out here.
What?
Up you go.  Right now.
What makes you so sure it was one?
No.  I didn't.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
No, he picked me up.
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
Hell, peanut...
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
What kinda trash talk is that?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
I do.
I'm goin'.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
Yeah, I'm here.
What's that?
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
Come sit by me.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
You talk to 'im some?...
Shake hands with your daddy.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Wouldn't make any difference.
What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Yes.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
In the head.
Through the forehead?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
By who?
I know... I remember.
Actually... I just want to go home.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
I just mean...
Because... because...
He heard everything we were saying.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Competence.
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Excuse me?
Is that in my chart?
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Better luck next time.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Sounds like a good one.
This is worth it.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Blocked.
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
Your aunt?
Maybe...
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Kinship. And what's here?
What?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
In a minute. Get us a table.
No thanks.
When?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm not going, with them.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Oh. Well. I...
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Simple.
Neither do I.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
I love you, Grady.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
About the baby.
And what do you think you might have said?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Oh?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Sure it is.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
What's that?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
That's weird.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
K through sixth.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
It was a beautiful present.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
The birthday party.
Early July.
C'mon, Walter.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
Don't talk like that.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
It's hard to describe.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I fell asleep.
No.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
What?
Know what?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Banished... yeah.
You seem a little hostile today.
Of course.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
It's very good, indeed.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
I don't need someone else.
You couldn't say.
Go home, Walter.
That's my answer.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
This is garbage!
People without cars.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What do you think?
Sorry.
So... what's your dark secret?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
Not tonight.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
Their power. They seduce me.
And what do you tell yourself now?
I love my brothers.
Us seeing each other.
I'm not scared.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Nothing.
I need a shower.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Your rig?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.
It's trying to communicate.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Give me that!!
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What's the timer set for?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Then how come you're not with him?
I'm thirsty.
This one is gorgeous.
Then why don't you try it on?
You already know what they are.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Yes, you should go.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
What! Get married?
Nothing.
Why?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I'm too sleepy.
Better dead.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
You men are all so dreadful!
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
What other boat?
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Thank you.
No. The owners are in Australia.
And how come you're up so early?
They didn't seem too good.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Who?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I just heard you.
Let's talk about something else.
Uh huh.
Who?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
In the confessional.
And what happened?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Are you married?
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
Who?
I don't know.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Do you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Yes.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
A mistake...
But you're troubled... aren't you?
I breathed!
I can't.
She can.
... makes me...
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Agnes, you're stupid.
You're a mistake.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Of telling you.
Because I wasn't worthy.
It grew.
I can't tell you that.
Who?
What do you think it's there for?
I have to throw up...
Who?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Yes.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes, who did this to you?
You saw it all didn't you?
H... how?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Yes.
Yes.
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
Was there a priest?
The science of psychiatry.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
About what?
And Agnes' father?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
I'd love one.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Nine.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
I'm a deserter, too.
He'll be pulp by now.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
I see you go to the night court.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Do I snore?
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Of course I can.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
But I won't.
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Thank you.
The big hammer?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And what do you do about it?
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
What?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Hello.
I'll look after meself.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
But I'm clean.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Oh, I see.
He's got you worried, then?
Shall I?
Don't be callous.
Well you're not going.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Don't exaggerate.
You've lost him.
Don't start. Look.
Sorry.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
What?
Nerves.
Well, he can't stop here.
Kill drive engines.
Then take her down.
Take a look.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
How's it coming on the engines?
Dead!
Is it alive?
The water will still recycle.
What?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
It wouldn't come.
Ask him.
Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Can you get them back?
How many?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
We can use the flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
Let's let the machine work on him.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Maybe we could write it together.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
They're on the next level up.
Okay.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Turn on navigation lights.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Anything else?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
Food-storage room!
Now what?
What do you think?  Now we go in.
By eating our food supplies.
So the next step should be --
Can we get to him?
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Oh man...
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
You win some, you loose some.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Not yet.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
How?
Is it still moving?
Thanks.
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Sounds great.
How many... how many people are missing?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
What time's sundown?
Please do.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
I am somebody.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
It wasn't meant to be.
Almost four.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
Champion to champion.
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo? Lunching in public?
She may be later than you think...
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Amen.
Frankly, I don't remember.
In time she'll be what you are.
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Then you're crazy.
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Okay.
It won't play.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
I thought you were going to be late-
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
I don't think that's funny!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Now don't get carried away-
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
Glory Hallelujah.
You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
Yes, dear.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
What have I got to do with it?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
Well?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
No trouble at all.
Right here.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Why not?
Harrington.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Roughly ten minutes.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
He's in love with you.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I just can't believe it.
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That was a pity...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
The play? All right, I guess...
How do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Too bad.
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
I promise.
--mine's better--
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
And you haven't called him?--
The fucking New York Times.
Why didn't we get that?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
And you will.  But not now.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
But you know who did.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
Can't help you.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
--you don't really think you're being followed?
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
No games, Irwin; give.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
My non-denial denial.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
I did all right on McCord.
Who's Colson, Harry?
--well, Sloan--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--maybe I'm tense--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Suck me...beautiful?
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
No idea.
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
I know, it sucks!
I think I've had one.
But that one time --
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Yeah, that's right.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Nothing!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
Yes.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
I told you.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
You've got something going?
Okay.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Um...okay...
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
You've just inherited The Bible.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Stifler!!
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Doing what?
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Just like sex with my wife.
Also like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
AHHHHHHH!
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Andy!
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
You on drugs? Huh?
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Looks like he lied to you too.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Because Gaston was after it.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
What do you mean, maniacs?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
What did she say?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Then come find me.
I shant!
Not you. Him.
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
What happened to your parents?
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
No! Well, yes, but
Yes, you do. You do.
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
I cursed then all!
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
And tell me that she's happy.
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
This guy's on television.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
You-you play... very well.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Well, where is it? I-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Nice car.
Well...
You sure?
Okay.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Oh! Italian, right?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
You- Do you love me?
Do I love you?
You don't want me to live with you?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Yeah.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
It was just great!
Very big spider.
Yeah?
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
That's sick!
Yeah.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
This is the first book that I got you.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Can I confess something?
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Oh, do yuh?
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Right before his un-American thing.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
We can show her the schoolyard.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
How about a ginger ale?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
We really had a good time.
...of possibly working together.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Yeah.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Would it make a difference?
Why last?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Leo?
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
Well, probably.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Never.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
I love her too, Joe.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
Harry called.
Monica.
We've heard lots about you.
Forget it, Judy.
Hm.  We should do it again.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You want me to uninvite her?
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Otis!
I know.
He's my favorite.
Has she called?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Don't I find what?
I meant Sally.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Uh-huh.
And Ryan works at home.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
You must have been a baby.
Sorry?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I don't need a drug.
Let's just go home, okay?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I...
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Oh great.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
It's much more personal in here.
The both of you.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
How should <u>I know</u>?
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
So...you two are in love?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Under the mat? 
Ma'am?
Oh!
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
No. Like a man.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
I don't understand --
You don't want me here --
Open it.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
What for?
Sure.
Gin.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Here.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
We're going to finish that gin game.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
I'm fine.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Gas?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Are you going to deny it?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
How do you work it with the key?
I'm not through with you yet.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Now what was your news, Baxter?
I got kicked in the head, too.
I see.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Very clever.
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
So what's it going to be?
No I didn't.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Something like that.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Family?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Doctor.
And what happened to you?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I don't believe you.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
I promise.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
What gives?
It won't happen again.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Yeah.
Get out --
Which part is that ?
No.
North ?
Let's talk about you.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Yes, sir --
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
No shit.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
No shit -- hot damn --
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Signs?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Who knows? Right.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Would he remember you ?
Maybe.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What is it?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Sure -- fine --
I got bored in Saigon.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Music?
I'm Kurtz.
You can't have water after morphine.
What Truth?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
And shut up.
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Well , who's in command here?
89   CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:  
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
43   CONTINUED:
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
26   CONTINUED:  
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Back against the bars.  Now.
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Be careful -- there're two of them.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
What's going on?
So what's the problem?
My home is here.  With you.
A daughter in Oregon.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I'm here to do my job.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
You broke the radio, remember?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Stay out of it.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
They'll have to come right past us.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Have they done blood tests on him?
No.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
My son is sick, okay?
Just how grateful I am.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
No, sir...
I can't. I work.
My son.
Yes.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Here's the trouble with never.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I'll never forget you said it.
I'll take a bus.
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
Because...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Uh-huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
I just love her.  How're you doing?
You think you're kidding.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Ask him.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Get out.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
No shit.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
I bet you fucking know!
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
One hour per man.
What does that mean?
Why?
Forget it!
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
He was killed.
Why?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
How old were you?
Jesus -- why?
Why not?
They become complicated... messy.
That's fiction.
You said you didn't trust it.
I don't.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What happens if you do?
That sounds nice.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Really?
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
What happened to her?
Honestly?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
That doesn't sound normal.
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Honesty.
Sure.
A dime.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Anything.
How would you like the funds?
This will take some time.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Like Custer huh?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
But how did the wall get here?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Both, see you later.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
He's lying! I am.
Did you see anything in the files?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Here!
No, by road?
Doug?
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
That's my mum's.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I've been around.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Let's have a look anyway.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
But we could go to London and live in England.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Thanks.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Run into Josh?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You are quite sure it's secure?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Very well.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
I don't want his money.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
York Ave.
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
Because that's where the fire is?
No. Not like you.
Maybe a little of both.
It's private.
And you have to meet my father.
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
You don't miss a thing.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
When I have something to say.
It's only 7:30.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
Loved?
Away from here.
Yes, one of many.
Pull over.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Yes, sir.
Materially or spiritually?
How -- how long does she have?
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I'd work backstage or something?
A similar triangle?
Scalene?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
No....
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Yeah. Maybe so.
But he does! Don't you see?
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Why?
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
That's just what I needed to hear.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
What theater was I at?
Hi, Marty!
Okay.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What'd you come out here for?
You love him?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
I don't care.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Yeah.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Sure.
Stay as long as you like.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Okay, no monkey business then.
Maybe.
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Arachtoid.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Let her out. In my custody.
It?  Who does?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Everybody okay up here?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
It's too dangerous.
Damn John Whorfin--!
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Hah!
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
Well not much.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
To do what?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Well, you just... sound a little–
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Well, I can tell you some stories –
...Yeah, okay.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
No... no...
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
What do you do, Fink?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Only fry you once.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Sometimes I really hate you.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
That's right.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
There's a name from the past.
I like you.
You can make a mistake.
Please.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What's it about?
Yes.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
I found Lisa Henderson.
What are you researching?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
What was the weapon?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Nilsen?
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
What about the shit they write?
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
We can do better. It needed more white.
Aren't they?
You want a drink?
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Sure.
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
You're not?
Not black.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Very well.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
What's his name?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
So what?
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I didn't know.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
That's ignorant.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
"Shreck's."  You --
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
You're not the Mayor.
Have we?
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You first.
Weird, huh?
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
What seems to be the problem?
Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Oxbridge Academy?
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Hey, what's your problem?
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
He'll be here.
Can he save her?
What are you talking about?
Maybe he melted.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Dick, don't push me right now.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
What say we turn up the heat?
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
What did you say?
No. You said I. I killed them.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
And another name for Mystery?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
What?
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Stop fighting.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
About what?
I'll take you with me.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
What did you see?
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Maybe we should just kiss.
... We could try that.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
Take 'em! I want his head!
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
I've considered that possibility.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
He's not crazy.
It's gone.
Great. How??
Holy shit. Holy...
Hi.....  Roses.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Ahm.... .
Howls he getting on with the family?
Yes, isn't he.
Great news.
I beg your pardon?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Quite right, sir.
And a car.
Great, good.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
What's gone?
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
This is going to take some time.
What about this Beetle guy?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Of course I did.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
But <u>we</u> let him out.
I didn't --
What makes you think she likes me?
What?
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
You don't kill anyone.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
Just one daughter.
We need help.  We deserve help.
No.  You don't want his help.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.

He's your cousin.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Stepmother.
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Any particular kind?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
... Oh? You've heard?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
Your family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Yes. Thank you.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Mentor...?
Yes. I was.
Our greenhouse.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
I see.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Do you like it?
I agree.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Yes, it is very good!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
I like to watch.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
No. I don't object.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Do you need a secretary?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's not that, I just...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Right, Chief.
Right, Chief.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
Well, Ben... I...
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I don't know.
Please, have a seat.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We’re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
I want to try.
What?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
We?
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
I'm a puppeteer.
People make mistakes.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Forget it.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Yessir.
Thank you, sir.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
You're insane.
Emily Dickinson.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Yeah.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
The usual, Barry.
My tits?
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
It better be.
What's he been in?
Tickets to Malkovich?
You wanted to be partners with me?
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
No. Don't be an ass.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I like that.
The Great Mantini?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Forget it.
Think, Jew florist?
Good morning, Lotte!
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Yes, Hi.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
Yeah, I saw them
Oh, Lotte...
I can explain about the portal, darling.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Don't pay to complain.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Ya think?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
You sure?
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
You?
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
She was only-
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Yeah, okay.
Why me, man?
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
The?  Who the fff--
Nothing.
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
And this guy peed on it.
I'm going home, Donny.
I was bowling--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
They were Nazis, Dude?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
Nancy's pretty good.
No, they--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Far from it.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Oh yeah?
You're not interested in sex?
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Now I got--
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Well...no, of course not--
What the fuck are you--
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
It's your roll.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
What about the toe?
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Nihilists!  Jesus.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Employed?
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Well. . . yeah.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
I don't think so.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Did you think I wouldn't?
Either that or feeding the worms.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Look, what's your problem?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
Wait.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
You're blind --
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Preventive medicine.
You don't know that.
Graffiti --
Look closer.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
Perhaps.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
I'll take my chances.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Let's talk to your husband--
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
It's like traveling back in time.
What?
What is <u>this</u>?
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Anna--
The, uh, blur there.
I can't let you in.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Fine.
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What're you doing with all this shit?
Goes right along with these two.
What?
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
At least you still have the tapes.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
That's why she kills children.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
No.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
Abby...
Your husband.
I just gotta see a guy.
On the phone. Was it for you?
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
...Huh?
What'd he say?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Yeah.
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
Isn't that what you want?
I own the place.
...Friday?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
No. It just made them feel better.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
Ya catch any fish?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
You said the usual--
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
For what?
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Okay.
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah. I get it.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Not yet.
Those are my breasts.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
I . I don't know.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Yes.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Are you a bad boy?
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Just get outta my bed.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Good, let's drink up.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's too bad.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know. he moved away.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Okay. yeah, call.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Who, me? Why should it?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
Okay. great!
Where to?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Frank!!
uh uh.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Derek!
Derek!
We'll take it.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
And I only deal with you?
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Sell it?
Yeah.  She told me.
Get me a six pack.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Ah, yes.  The murder.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Okay.
Just sell it, Derek.
Try the back bedroom.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
In how long?  A week?
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
It would be my pleasure.
It's beautiful.
Freedom.
Family.
Beautiful girls?
Diego is my brother.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
You're not going to trial?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What do you guys want?
Tuna.
Why are you smiling?
Pablo said no?
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
You can call me Dad if you want.
California, huh?
You swear?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
But I've got school.
You swear?
I don't believe you.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Yes, I am.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
I understand. What's your question?
What "group"?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
I don't do that kind of thing.
Let's try ...
It's a question of habit ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Yes, a name for the operation.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Then you can go.
Increase his heart rate.
Did they argue the day before he died?
You may call your next witness.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
A little after eleven.
I assume his girlfriend.
Yeah.
Yes.
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
It didn't.
She left me.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
No.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
That bastard!
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
Three fifteen.
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
We're not animals.
Try.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
You can see me now.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
You're a monster.
Mr. Roston?
If he files are you going to take the case?
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
No -- never.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Not this kind of heat.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
I don't mind waiting.
Francesca. Robert.
About a year and a half.
We got engaged.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, sure. Great.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Couple. Want to help?
Yes.
No, I don't mind.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
Yes, thanks.
For who?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
WHAT!
Hell no!
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Just some flies.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Anywhere but here.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
I manage them.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
Shit, that was fast.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
It was just like in my head.
Should I?
What we have to do is call the police.
Here, put this in his mouth.
Admit what?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where's what?
Stay away!
All part of the business.
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?
I need you ...
Violet, I won't let you leave.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Just hurry.
Don't tell him --
Everything you couldn't.
You murdered Gino!
I had to.  You made me.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Shut up!
They were in a car accident.
Yes, I understand.
I should have let him kill you.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Good idea.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Why?
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
My pleasure.
Not exactly.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
A beer?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
The redistribution of wealth?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I don't.
What was it then?
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
I am, but ...
Then what?  Exactly.
Good.
Who is Gino?
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Why?
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
I was so afraid you ...
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
I know you will.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.
...it's a problem...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
So now you know.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Did you?
That'd be great.
You have blood on your pants.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
What does that mean?
What?  Like amnesia?
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
We're about an hour away.
I guess.
Anytime.
You knew he was coming.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- we'll tell them what happened --
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
xxxxxx
Enhance it.
Abbott wants to talk.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
How did I get here?
What have you done to my flat?
... yer ducts.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
You sound worried.
What?
Layton! Oh shit!
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Very smart.
A terrorist?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Do you know what you're doing.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Bastard!!!
Jack ...
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Is it stamped?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Really.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Cut it out, Sam.
We? Don't blame me!
Oh ... Jesus!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Where are you going?
Take care.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
I know that.
I did it for you.
Yes.
A woman eh? I see.
I won't be held responsible.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
This isn't rare!
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
What? Who is this?
No, sir.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Fixed itself.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Can you fix it?
What do they want you or?
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Ten-four, hon.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Yes.
Did you see my father?
He's working a double shift.
How is she?
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
The ghosts--
I think the worst is over.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
I've taken that into consideration.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Frank!
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You sure?
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
And the rule was...
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What?
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Ravenous homosexual.
Sure.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Yes.
People phoned in.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
Sit down, stop.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Stop it.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
It's started.
No, I don't think so.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I wish it were you giving the story.
I don't know.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Hey?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Excited.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Because you're nuts.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Uh-huh.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
How can you say that to me?
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
It's better when you let me say it.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
Through the closet.
What, right now?
Are you nervous, Walter?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
You know it.  I'm out of here.
What's it called?
Me too.
It wasn't easy.
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Here here...
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Nothing...nothing at all.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well...
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Uh, sure.
You can cut the crap.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Good morning Walter!
Here here!
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Wrong answer!  No prize.
Wheels?
Which way did she go?
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Jealous?
So I noticed.
You broke up with my machine?
Hi there.
Yeah.
Well, stay here tonight.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Thanks.
Who?
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Like my homework.
Please.  It's so '91.
Why don't we see a movie?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
Cramps?
This is it.
She --
It's true.
Why do you keep saying that?
Oh, him.
No -- you don't have to --
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Oh, fuck you!
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
And where are they now?
Good enough!
B'bye.
So very much.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Well, I hope so.
Throw it out.
You're kidding.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Wit-tay.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
I don't think so.
I am.
You said "Crash".
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
I know what it is.
I got lured.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
I'll learn.  C'mon--
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
G'night.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I'm not interested yet.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
No.  Please.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Oh let's not...
Oh both of you, of course...
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
You're outta here!
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Why am I a fuck?
No.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
And where can I go?
Hit me in the chest with this...
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Can I give you my testimony?
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
...and one helluva guy.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
What are you talking about?
Why are you doing this to me?
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
It's a pity in this...
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Well...
I can't! I'm tied!
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
They payin'?
I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Between...
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hey, Rich.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
All right.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
It's none of my business?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
What are you -
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
She was afraid to call you.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Well, sir, I was just...
I...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Call security.
I-I'll do it.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
It's chinchilla.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
What are you talkin' a- ?
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
Pretty serious.
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And where'd you go?
What did Jennifer have?
What if he won't stop?
I can back him off.
I am not!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
...and hypocrisy.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
Can't do it with both hands?
What?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You gotta go back out there.
Yes.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
It's instinctive, you know.
He tries to do everything...
We can't help him if -
For what?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
And I mean... that's no good.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
I understand.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Fine.
Sure.
Okay.
Oh, come on.
Bye.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Mm-hm.
Yes, you did.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
All right, all right.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Yes.
Promise?
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
Here.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
You're driving me nuts!
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Of course.
Get up.
Every night, on the couch.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no!
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
No it's not.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What did you say?
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
I know.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
You think so?...Selina?
You can't get away with..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
What did--?
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
This is one way.
Taking messages.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
You never miss a trick.
Not this minute.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
Who?
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes sir.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Whose money is this?
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Do you have to point that?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Think you could do a picture of me?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Only one way to find out.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
My pleasure --
And then?
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Where do I turn?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
Persistent.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Like treacle.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
You can't leave me then, can you?
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
What look?
How special?
I'm not on my own, am I?
That's good...
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What does that mean?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
I'm thinking of your man.
That's a start.
So they do know.
Kind of wish I didn't.
A little.
Should have stayed a girl.
Only if you kiss me.
What's her?
She from Scotland too?
It's a secret.
No.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
I was trying to get out of something.
My pills...
Jimmy?
More what?
What would you do for me?
Tell me what she wore.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Carnations.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
That's wise, Tommy.
Do you now.
Have a look at him.
My pleasure.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You're never out, Fergus.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Was I?
Why would you do that?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I told him.
Who'd you think it was?
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
So it's on the street.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Kill me.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
You could have said no.
Shouldn't take it personally.
My pleasure, Jody
Shut up, would you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
The best.
I've often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Don't think that way.
I'm sorry.
What?
What does that mean?
He believes in the future --
I think that's what you ordered.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Why do you think I brought you here?
Adam --
I sure am. Get it.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Of course there is!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
You lied to me so many times --
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Only we call them agents.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Very sweet.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Oh.
Who?
Barely, yes.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Oh. Then who's this one?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Me? Why me?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
The last one, please.
No, thank heaven.
But you're -- divorced?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Why can't you be serious?
Cutting it out.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
No.
Why?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
You mean, you're a thief?
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
Meaning what?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
I'm very confused.
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
A letter? May I see it?
Did you?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Okay.
What should we give him?
Voilà what?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Now you're angry.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Come on. You can't stay here.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
On the street where you live.
How would you like a spanking?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Be careful, Peter.
A quarter of a million dollars.
The man you had the fight with.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Good night.
Yes?
I don't understa--
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
He took care of Charlie for us.
She's my daughter, Tom.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
I will. Is that all?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
You know where I can find her?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Why?
Ok.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Does she fuck?
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Don't you think it's sick?
What?
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
Why?
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I do not.
I don't know. I kind of am.
That's not why we broke up.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Yes?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
The library. I'll be fine.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
Attacked how?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
The word is Mob.
The principal?
Just thinking about something.
What?
I'm not leaving it here.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Unfair?!
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...truck.

I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
...doing?!
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
No, no, no.
That's...
I ain't playin' that.
Ah, one of them's in the back.

Oh...
 Nice job back there.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

 Okay.  That didn't work.

All right, let's go.
He's crazy!
I'm crazy?
 All right.  Hey.
What?
You're fucked, man.
You know.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
I mean, if that gun was...
...shit.
Yeah.
Hey!

Arlo, shut up.

Yeah.

That was quick.
I'll keep an eye out.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Jake, listen.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Why?
I'm not.
How are you, Lou?
How'd you get past the guards?
No. It was an accident.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
How do you happen to know her?
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
C'mon I'll show you.
They only dump the water at night.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Of course.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Mrs. Mulwray?
What do you mean?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
Where you were when your husband died.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
No, not for that one.
So you married your father's business partner?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
The Valley?
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Why?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
When was the last time?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Your eye.
Where are you going?
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
This morning.
You mean she just found out?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
Upstairs. Why?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Katherine.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Oh no.
Ida Sessions.
Oh, good.
I cut myself shaving.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Yes...
Yes...
Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
The L.A. River?
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
Yeah.
But...
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
What about?
Yeah.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
So I can have these? 
But you don't have any kids!!!
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
We'll talk about that later.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Thais.
That's all there is.
Two cents.
I'll write it myself.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Sure, sure.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Charlie?!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Yes.

Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Emily -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
It's - all over -
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Oh, me -
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan!
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Thanks.
Where'm I going?
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Not my wife - not either of them.
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Charlie -
Are you finished?
What do you mean by that?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Well, thanks a lot.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
I had a toothache.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
I think you'd better leave now.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
I take it she likes the guy.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Awww. That was so cute.
I feel nauseous.
Just now.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
So you're really getting married?
Was I right?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
But you were.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
What about Sing?
Sang.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I left like an hour ago.
Just me.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Excuse me?
I'll assess all I want!
Are you open?
I thought Redding had like three balls!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Great story, isn't it?
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
It would stand to reason, yes.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
I think they were Catholics.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
What's a jizz-mopper?
I guess not.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Julie Dwyer died.
Why not?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Twenty-two; same as us.
I swear.
No!
Who found him?
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
Why should I loan you my car?
You work in a video store!
If you must.
Exactly.
Five hundred dollars.
You're bullshitting.
Holy shit. That girl?
You're lying.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Shut the fuck up!
This life?
I should shit or get off the pot.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Who're you kidding? You can so.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
It's not like I'm miles away.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
To say the least.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Thirty-fire.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
No, she's getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
What's that mean?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
You used to go out with her?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
I was kidding.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How flattering.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
It better be up to and including me.
You're a pig.
You!
What do you mean?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I feel sick.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Veronica, I love you...
WHAT?
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
You hope what feels good?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I'm not sad.
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Dental School.
Like hell you are!
Twenty bucks.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
I admit, I can be bought.
Surprise me.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
My pleasure.
Fine, I guess...
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I don't think you do.
I don't understand?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Of course I do.
You attacked me.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Never
Helluva time for vanity!
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
I won't do it.  No way.
Take the rope.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
There is.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Kill him when he gets down.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
I've been cured.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Yes. They want to help.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
What crime did you commit.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
What job and how much?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Blue eyes?
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Vitamins will it be then?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Yes!!!
Just part of hospital routine.
I just say what the other person would say?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
And when do I get out of here then?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
You have, my son.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Prison custody?
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Yeah... Pete the English.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
It's no big deal.
Bottega.
But not now?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
You still carrying passengers?
Jesus...
Oh, my, yes.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
It got crashed!  I didn't...
You should start a union.
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
It's not me.
What?
You said you were visiting friends!
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
I need the job.
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
What you mean, no?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Yeah?  What happened?
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
One more.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
...indifferent.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Drop me off here!
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
I can't promise you anything.
You saved my life.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
What is it with you and the space program?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Uh huh.
Shoot.
Is he dead?
How'd he die?
He was murdered.
Not this again.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Not today.
This way.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
Back where?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
You knew just what I was there for.
What about you?
Now she tells me.
You've never seen her run.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Please, sit.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
You're --
Oh?  How's he doing?
With me.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Do you have a minute -- ?
It'll just take a moment.
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you?
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
It's beautiful.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
By our standards... yes.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Because I can't.
Could we hear to the moon?
That's my scientist.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
So who...?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Yavol.
Ellie --
'My father's house has many mansions.'
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
Can you try?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
If you came back.
Thank you.
Maybe that's okay.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I can't do this --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
In other words.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
Have your department make a full report.
But I made this arrangement --
Cut that backsass!
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
Here, Mom.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
You just said he could eat anything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
The same as the first time...
I never hurt nobody...
What Friday?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Oh, I think you will.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Because of your phone calls.
How did you know they were stockings?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
I'll get a locksmith.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Okay.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Lieutenant  Quinn.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Talk to Nikko...!
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Right.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Helen Hudson...
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Hard to say.
It's hospital policy...
Yeah, and a dimple.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
But what am I going to do?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Lie?
I answered these questions last night.
What if it's got a pattern?
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
No rounds for another three hours.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
I wish I could have seen that.
That's where I always go when I get out.
Do you?
Home free.
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Shhhh.
You, too. Kick ass today.
The restaurant, too?
Michael, take it easy.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
She's only known the guy a few months.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
That's a big question.
Especially now.
So, what do you say, Let?
No, no.
So will you?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I've met someone else.
Here's the ring.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I'm glad you're doing well.
What does that mean?
I need someone to work on budget projections.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass.
They don't have a murder weapon?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Who?
Oui.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Why are you here?
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Yeah -- you do that.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Good word.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Thank you.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Where are you from?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
A thousand dollars?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Okay boss.
Great fuckin' song.
What room number?
Go look.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
I'm not going to leave you.
We both know I'm already dead.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
God, I want to go home.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Get in the car.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I know where she went.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
Thanks.
Something like that.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Sounds boring.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I didn't have the heart.
Then leave her to me.
And if I use them to kill you?
I'm just playing around.
I owe you nothing.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
You're too young to understand.
Really?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
They forced me to marry!
Not another lecture!  On guard!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I will.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
A murderer?
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
I don't know...
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Thanks, babe.
No further.  I'm serious.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
You're welcome.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Mister Funboy lives there?
You gotta go now, I bet.
In a better place.  I hope.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Right.
That's ancient history.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Magic.
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
I'll be fine.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
You a lesbo?
No.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
It's not really important.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
No thank you.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Doing what?
Okay?
What are you doing?
Reading.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Oh please.
What?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
I'm sorry about that.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
The football stud?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Okay.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
But I thought high school is only four years.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
No. This is going to be our last session.
You do?
Yummy.
Honey, is something wrong?
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Yes!
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
One.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
I hate it too.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
So? How'd it go last night?
She shot you down.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Kind of.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Well done.
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Yes, you already did.
I did?
I did?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
I got my wish anyway.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
Times have changed.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Yes, daddy.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Voices from an old dark house!
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
No.
This is more fun than just pretend.
Oh, please!
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
But why?
I'm trying to.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
No, thank you.
Why hasn't he got a head?
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes...yes, that's true.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Your lips look delicious.
No, it was another woman.
Does she have PMS?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
He's a very talented musician.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
Can't you get contacts?
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
My vision got worse again.
It is so hot in here.
No you don't, believe me.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Why the fuck would you do that?
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
You're such a good friend.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
No.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Okay, you busted me.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
A man killed in Central Park.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Oh my god, what happened?
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
Tell her I'm eating.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
And he was missing an arm.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
No one available.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
I see.  One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Why are they after you?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
Which one?
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
I'm...  being...  punished.
How do you know I'm innocent?
The usual...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Oh... Okay.
Right and don't embellish.
Great.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Share...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
You can't kill a President.
Bob...
This is undeclared income.
Choices?
You could buy it on payments.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
I'm afraid so.
Really?   Crazy?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
What?
This is wrong, Alan!
He's not.
And it's proving quite effective...
Perceptual?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
You got a gun?
Certainly.
`Bleed for your king.'
Mind if I sit down?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Yes.
You find people jobs?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
What about the intro?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Quiet!
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Ain't no place safe.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
Maybe.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
No, sir.
In the battle, sir.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
What is that?
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
YAWP!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Don't stop!
You have another choice.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
Come on, that's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Er  No.
It's my birthday.
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
This play?
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
And no questions asked.
The thieves.
Then who are you?
He's with them.
Jesus Christ lady...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Self sufficient...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
How do you know that?
A meat locker.
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
No...
I don't take orders at all.
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
Joey...look at me...
I'm stuck...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
I'm looking...
Shut up!
She fucked you?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
Yeah.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Here. Hit it here.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Tell him, Vince.
You mean...?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Oh, Jesus.
Here.
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
What?
Frost.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
This is horrible!
Merle, I wanna go home!
I know.
From Nam?
Pow?
Pow.
Promise! You gotta promise!
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
No. No way!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
You wanna bet?
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
What's that noise?
What?
I gotta get back, Nick.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Where?
Yeah!
The fuck I did!!!
Up.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
I'm not voting for you.
Remember my promise.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Not anymore.
You sure?  I can help you.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Well, that's good enough for me.
Doucet killed my partner.
How do you know?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
We're partners, aren't we?
...Have you been drinking?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Yeah.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Thank you, Belle --
He lied to me again.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Afraid ... of what?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
The seventh day of April --
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
There's no joy in it for me.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Coming.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
I'd love to.
I'll never get my washing done.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Jabez!
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
I guess we won't.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
What mountain?
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
I won't forget.
Of course not --
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
I want someone to talk to ...
Mind if I play some tunes?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
What does he want?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
Who said we were terrorists?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
I'm a cop from New York.
Sounds better than nothing.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
You don't want to know.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Come on, what's under this?
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
I love you.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
I'm really shakey.
What trip?
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
What?
I don't have a choice.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Well, then...
Right.  See you sometime.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
Call me Sonny-boy.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Calm down, you're not ...
I'll see what they'll do.
They were ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
What if I take you with me?
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
Yeah.
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Howard!
No, not until after they killed him.
I used to, but I stopped.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Alive.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
We'd kill ourselves.
Everybody!  Back here!
Have him walk in backwards.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
I speak what I feel.
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
Did it hurt?
What do you think, dumbshit?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
No. Please enlighten me.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I said stop it.
I can certainly think of one more!
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>
No. What's the big deal?
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Is that the only tape you got?
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
No!
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
What responsibilities?
He's completely innocent.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
And move to Long Island...
Fuck!  My money!
What?
No, just checking.
Quit bullshitting.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Christmas came early.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Hot.  Hot.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Your memory is really getting bad.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Yeah.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
He's right.
On the rebound.
HATE!
He's nuts.
Sez who?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
How do you know this?
So what do you want me to do?
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Actually we have something for you.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Excuse me.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Gotcha.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
What?
Famous? I've never heard of it.
What?
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
Oh, is this your special place?
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Your mom made a move on me.
Shut up!
I will stop this car right now.
No.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Yea!
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
You're always your harshest critic.
You have beautiful eyes.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
A turd.
No. Look.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
You mean the lunch room?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
What are you talking about?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Wow, you are smart.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
What papers?
The evidence of what?
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Piter.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
Nothing.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
No.
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
Long live the fighters!
Pain.
Stop him, Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
I predict we're lost.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
I didn't feel well...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Mmph?  Where am I?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
It's that easy?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
What?
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, it was only one review.
I thought he was dead.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
But Greta say --
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Oh.  My condolences.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
What's uncanny?
Lines around the block.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Yes!
YES!  JUST DO IT!
What octopus motor?
I do.
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
Al!!
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Really? They were..
Tell me.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Your brother's here.
Send him away.
Hey, he cheated on her.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
She wouldn't tell me.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our foibles, our foibles!
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Right.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Okay ...
It's... okay
Leave. Go.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
So...?
Twenty-nine.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
No. It's your fault.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What?
What is?!
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Why do you do that?
Marcia's living with a singer?
What's the dif --
No problema.  You want a picture?
No. Am I supposed to?
Do you still have it?
Thanks... That's ...
Yeah. Why?
pierdes.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Why are you lecturing me?
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Uh, Jim?
Door was open.
You sure?
Yep.
Three twenty-five.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
Yeah.
What do you mean?
No way I It doesn't make sense.
And 290 "disregards," right?
I'm not like you.
Well, I do.
Sorry.
What do you mean?
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
What's it to you?
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Of course... But how?
How'd you get them to retract?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Let's just kill them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Of course...
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Yeah, so...
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Answer yes or no.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
I'll break them, sir.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What?
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
Decorated?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Lynn Bracken.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
Why not?
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
I know how he feels.
None.  Call it a hunch.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
Officer White?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
I like it!  I like it!
Down around my ankles.
Around.
What's wrong, Trash?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
It'll be our secret.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Working whores with squad two.
What'd he give to you?
Nothing.
I don't know what that means.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
I'll come straight there.
A direct one.
I don't know who he is.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Okay.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Wait. What do I do?
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
One-twenty.
I called my wife!
How'd you have the manpower to--
Why'd you leave?
The NSA killed him.
Them.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
No.
Shit.
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
What size?
I'll be right back.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Thanks.  Who are you?
The robbery.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Something bad happened tonight.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
What do you mean?
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
I see her for business.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
I know.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
That's okay.
You opened the thing?
Sir?
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Why would I--
Eat your fish.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
I'm gonna fix it.
You're a moron, you know that?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
You're wrong.
Fuck you. You may have to--
My shoe?
You're Brill.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
I have to go lingerie shopping.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Where's Stacy?
Where's mom?
Where've you been?
Table 122?
Into what?
Yes.
You're tired.
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
Why not?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
The originals?
Sir--
If they've looked at the video.
And if it wasn't?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
Puffed cheese?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
What kind of fossils?
That insults them.
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
What do you hate most?
You bastard, I was believing you!
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Oh dear.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
I don't know.
Don't cut me.
You were in Africa?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
No.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Are you planning to be the exception?
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Thank you.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
- to her cooking.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
I try not to expect you.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Only we have to go to work.
Yessir.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
This was your garden?
Through a window.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Too late now.
Who am I?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
I'll call an ambulance.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Excuse me?
So alive.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We go underwater?
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Let's just see how we do.
Our equipment has arrived.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
A dozen times.
To our...partnership.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
In eye of that painting.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
I always knew you'd do the job.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
The eight billion. From them to us.
Right. The eight billion.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
In the van.
It better be worth it for me.
Remind me why.
Suspicious, after all these years?
I'm waiting for the tell part.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Probably not.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
It's those files you asked for.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Both.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
And you can't?
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Why not?
Fuck Kurt.
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Corey.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Ten?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Thanks for reminding me.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
You are someone.
I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.
What do you want, a joke?
Thinking.
About what?
What's going on?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
What?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Everyone's invited, of course.
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
He will join us or die, My Master.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Yes.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
I take it back.
That should do nicely.
Beautiful.
Would you please stop calling me that?
A mining colony.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Thanks to you.
No hard feelings?
Repairs ...
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
This ought to be good.
No.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
What?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Are the coordinates set?
That sounds familiar.
I understand.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I'll be back later.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
What did you say?!
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That they are.
Believe what?
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
We'll see.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
That's the deal.
Having second thoughts?
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.
Are you crazy?
No screamin' shit.
What the hell is this?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
It is deep...
Of Merlin?
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Guenevere...
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I'm going.
I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
A lovestruck page!
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Why?
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Just show the sword.
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
Oh, I see.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
You're a nice man.
No thanks Karl.
Fine thank you.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
Please go away.
I'm Father Karras.
Pretty close.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Are you sure?
What?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
You think?
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
I don't know, I just thought.
How do you know?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Hi Father.
So what's wrong with her?
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
How's the girl?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
What's playing.
Another one. Had your lunch?
No.
You and Regan?
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Always.
I've seen him.
Only what I read in the papers.
It's possible. Possible however…
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I could have you deported, you know that?
Bastards! Stop!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes
Sometimes.
I don't know.
Why not?
Give me the keys!
Mondays.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
No bones.
Two at a time?
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Get your hand off me.
Recognize these two characters?
When they coming in?
What's the point?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Lotta water.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
It was an accident.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Only on odd days.
You gotta go.
It never was.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
How about these?
Two years ago.  March.
Sunday.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Fine.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
She's a big girl.
Celebrating.  Join me?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Nothing. We get nothing.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Right.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Yeah.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
We ran long.
Miss --
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
Where's your dress?
Do I look like I'm naked?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
They're nines.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Give me that.
Great.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Forget it.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
He doesn't bite.
The name's Baker --
Downstairs.
He'll come around.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Huh?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
You want me to walk you?
It's a shitty  song.
How do you know?
Sure.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Long story.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Look, if you want to leave...
So ... ?
So how's the cat food business?
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Huh?
I've given it up.
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Why not?
Ever go to church?
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Merry Christmas.
Sure.
Eddie.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
He hit a guard.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Like ...
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
And you wouldn't be.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Don't hang up ...
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
That's what they always say.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
The Admiral?
What?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
I'm just having some fun.
What do you know about it?
No.
-- I've got to study.
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
Back then -- who wasn't?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
I don't know.  Maybe...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
What about me?
What’s going on here?
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
I think I could figure it out.
Five thirty.  Okay.
She said that?
I never won anything in bowling.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
You just said everyone needs something.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Why not?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Get out, I call 911.
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids’ recital.
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
For us, Kate.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Worse, you mean...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Don’t get on that plane!
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Hey, are you okay?
Is there anything I can do for you?
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I've got plenty of places to go.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I should have done more, run more tests --
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
You've been working out.
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Ben did this.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Yes, thanks.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
Excuse me?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
A surgeon might...
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
What's that?
You mean Inner Space is endless?
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
Where we going?
That makes two of us.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
...What're you talking about?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Yeah.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
Oh, geez.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
...The heck d'ya mean?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
You're not a C student.
Hold on.
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah.
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
...Brainerd?
Yah, I see.
but do you know that for sure without -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Sir? Right now?
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Norstars.
2:30.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Oh, yah?
Yah.
Aw, Norm.
Yah?
Oh, pretty good.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
I'm sorry.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Margie Olmstead?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Norm?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
- looking.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
Dynamite?
What does that mean?
Who do you think could've done this?
Practicing what?
I'll expose you.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
It's for men.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Is this a trick?
Answer the question!
Marla, no, wait...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Tyler?
... You know me?
You were in here last Thursday night.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Now, find your power animal.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
...no ...no ...
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Yeah.
Would that be a problem?
What?
Me?
Anyone?
I know that.
Same here.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Okay.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
Nothing.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What... ?
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Proceed with remote detonation.
Why what?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Excuse me?
You told me you'd say that.
Really?
Did you hear what I just said?!
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Let go of me!!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Signs?
So let's do it.
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
That lucky bastard.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
She did.
Yeah?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
Like... 4:25.
Nothing is... anymore.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
No one's that strong.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
That's right, buddy.
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
You never been in one of those things.
I suppose you have...
Duck soup.
Forget it.
Where's his father?
Nguyen is good boy.
Typical...
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
What?
Not my people.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
But now it's free, right?
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
My agent.  I called my agent.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
Fine.  I'll say no.
Free?
Yes.  They're free.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
I don't know.
Can I take you to lunch?
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
I'm still scared.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You're out numbered son.
You won't be alone for long.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Got any Ethel Merman?
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
You don't have to say that.
I don't drink coffee...
No, I...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
You said.
Out where?
You're the pathetic one, not me.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
No, let's go...
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
I didn't get it, did I?
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
You know who it once belonged to?
Daddy's very ill.
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Tita, I've got to go...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Yes, intentionally.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I don't think that's accurate...
I don't believe vou.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Yeah, I think I could.
I'll be back later...
Catherine...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
Jesus, what a rude person...
That's an old maid's tale.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Why you have an attitude for?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
What?
You know somebody around here?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
You got a boyfriend?
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think by Twenty-two.
What you want with her anyway'
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
Um, yeah I think so.
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Not really.
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
Unbelievable.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I ought to get some sleep.
Fletch, this is dumb.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Two bs?
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
You find the source?
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I'd have been long gone.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Right.
Check.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Don't say shoot, okay.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
So were my parents.
You ordered it here?
God...
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
But I've seen the deed.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
No.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Cabana one.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Lock's busted.
I commend him on his choice
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Why not? Oh shit... really?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
John!
Of course.
No, I ain't got you...
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
But I am...
Right away!
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Contacts.
I like.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
Hey, they blew me.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
Everything is everything.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Well try, okay?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
... Salvatore?...
That's a relief.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
Willie Mays.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Why not?
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Four.
Third time around.
What is that old building?
What I know is what I told you.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
You're shitting me!
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
The future guy?
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
No, I don't.
Do you know where I found this?
Uh, huh.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Next time lets put some money on it.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
29-years ago.
No wait, don't go!
But you're not...you're not still here.
I lost you.
Fire.
On the job?
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
Something happened, something...
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What are we like in...1998?
I'm right here, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
John, he's got my driver's license.
Okay, okay...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Sully!  Is that you?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Look who's talking.
Are you a good cop, John?
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an att --
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Chuck... look.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Why don't you help us?
Not us!  He's really creepy.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Who's Horace?
Alright, alright.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
I could swear I heard...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Daddy, what is going on?
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Okay.  There's one.
What's it to ya?
You gotta be kidding!
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
Please don't do anything crazy.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Save your...
Twenty.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About what?
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
He bought you that?
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Not another word, do you hear me??
Nothing.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
Oh dear God...
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
He is not.
Am I? Let's find out.
You can and you will!!
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
It's not that simple.
After your parents passed away?
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I heard you weren't coming.
Just radio for help, okay???
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
It's over, finished and done with.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Here we go.
No, we're not.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Our Peter?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
The Red Sox
They'll lose because they're my team.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
What else?
It's your best play, Nicky.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Alma Wetzel.
She's my gynecologist.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
This could be it!
It's me. Nicky.
You know the answer to that.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
Washed away.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Why do you care?
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
You know what.
One more time.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
Is what true?
But you're his friend.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I'm going home to my machine.
As I told you about English policemen.
Eleven.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Some of it good, I hope.
Did they take your clothes?
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
Hm.  Is it?
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
That's when you take advantage.
It's split the Government.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Er, no...
I like football.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
You know I'm scared of heights.
They found my eyelash.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Again?
How the hell did you get here.
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why not?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Why would we do that?
I know about you.
Where?
Does it have a name?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
That's right.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Texas is a big state.
I'll bet you can.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Like what?
I didn't mean police.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
I don't want to hear it.
No more about Beynon.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Oh my God.
Suit yourself.
Two.
What about the vault?
Dillinger got killed.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Sure am.
How about twenty thousand?
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Was he?
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I don't know. That's all I was told.
What about?
Though nicer than most?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
What?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Is he coming here?
Entertaining.
Sure I'm sure.
Right.
That's what he was saying about you.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Ta-ra.
What you going to do?
You wouldn't.
Not much.
Jack Carter.
What you doing around here then?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Nasty way to go.
You ever get 'em?
I...I don't know.
And now...
It's too...
No.
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
You...
You build it!
What?
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
How do you know he'd buy them?
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Hey.
No.  Not actually.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
That's right.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
Is that what I said?
Yes.
What does that mean?
Why would they come to me?
Yes.  I'm sure.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
That's none of your fucking business...
Why?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Because you listened.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
What?  You can't do any what?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...
What?
They aren't?
Was I?
Thieves.
Yes.
Did they catch...?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Go to lunch, George.
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Would you excuse us, please...?
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...after the thirtieth...
Yes.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I'm not sure I have two.
Because I say so.
That's alright.
Mmm.
No.  It hadn't.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Only the beginning...
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
They...
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
What is it?
Uh...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
No.  She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I can't regotiate.
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You going to turn State's?
Why not?
They took 'em...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
To do business.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
What can we do?
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
He's the head of the family.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Wait'll you see!
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
We have time.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
What?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I can't let him down.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
I know he's in Israel.
Twenty-five this time.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
I don't think that's necessary.
Is he related to the witness?
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Why don't you sit down?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Where can we talk?
Right here.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
No, I meant lose his family.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
The money was sent.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
No, I'm fine.
So, that occurred to me.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
I do not.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Some water.
Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
The same assurance we got from you.
He supports me.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Fuck you.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
What's to be jealous of?
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You did not know?
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Football in college.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
But it's just my face you want to draw.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
This David's a friend?
I don't like to talk about that.
No.  I could have, though.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
What happened?
How long were you...?
You're talking through your hat now.
Something happened to him?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Good.  Let's get dry.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
Have a drink?
Good.  Fine.
You didn't, Jimmy.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
More your line.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Just go.  We can manage without you.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
I guess.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
Let them go --
Something like that -
Consider me gone, Detective --
Cadillac.
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
C'mon, man ...
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
There's no one left ...
What does that mean -- ?
You getting my checks ... ?
We'll take it...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
What do you say, Toby?,
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Don't go there, Toby --
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah --
About what?
What?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
He's gonna kill you -- !
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
I gotta get my tool --
Okay.
Oh. Okay. Right.
No. Open her ...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
Wrong preposition...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
I'll see you soon --
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
She soars -
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
Not really -
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Who's gonna do that?
I flushed it down the toilet.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
I got scared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Paulie was just talking about him.
It's been six months.
Have a drink first.
There are cops all over the place.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I better call again.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Tommy  ...
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
That's important.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
Gone.
What?
She went to Medical school in California.
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Okay.
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
She's not stupid.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Yeah, can I help you?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
What're you doing?
That's right.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
I think so.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Find out what?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
I won't talk first.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Oh, come on, Sean--
Oh, that's nice--
What?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Why not?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Where were you?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Look at me. What do you want to do?
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I kind of got that impression.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Your house must have been a zoo.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
I'm supposed to understand this.
I've never seen your place.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Some, a little.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
I know. I just do.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
How 'bout you?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Gallon or two?
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
She got to make it.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Got a warrant?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Excuse me for asking.
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
Just around that next bend.
I never heard nothin' about it.
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Thought you was in jail.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
But we can still do it, honey.
Lookin' for a job?
I stay in my own yard.
That's where I get off.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
No plants.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
I like the tent better.
No'm.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Sometimes they do.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
What's that--detour?
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
There, them stripy ones.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
But what about this?
Man bones?
Morning.
You don't...
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Don't say that.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
--She's not dead---
Like love?
Is it something you've done?
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You never could have kept this from me.
You don't understand...
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
Mmm.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Out Loud?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Like a union?
Hard to get good help these days.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Nope.
Yup.
He using her.
One cannot love and kill.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
I'll pay.
They blame you for the compromise.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Tell them my house exploded.
I spoke to your father the other day.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
No. You drove us here.
He sold me this bad boy.
That's too bad.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Just who's been laughing at who here?
You sleeping all right in that house?
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
What?!
I won't ask you to.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Why?
Is that your version of a pep talk?
What?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I didn't see it.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Sure.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
How's everything?
I should be in by two.
Okay.
Doing what?
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
Why?!
I'm not pretending anything!
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Well, it's good that you're there.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Everything all right.
I don't understa-
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
What was it like?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
How much longer do you think?
Long enough.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
...as they snoop onto us.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Curtis.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Yeah! Sure.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Yeah. RISC is good.
If I win, you become my slave.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
What?
Wanna go for a swim?
Homicidal?
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
What, it left a note?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
When did you find this out?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Don't get angry.
We've been better.
Who's that?
Not without Jamie.
I don't know!
What does that mean?
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
It's okay..it's okay.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Rachel!
Yeah.
No.
Don't you mean what you do best?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Right here, Ben.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
We just talked.
Sure.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Lies.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Yeah, sure.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Can we watch the monster movies?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You're coming with us...
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
No, he called late last night.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
I cry at the opera.
It does.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
What are you doing here?
How-how's Frederick?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Well, sure.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Oh, right.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Oh, don't say those words!
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But not over me?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Lee... uh...
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Was I?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I didn't say that.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Leave me alone, can you?!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Mom, come out!
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mm-hm.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Why?
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
You've been with someone!
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
It was on your shirt!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, now-- 
I know...I know.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
...you know?  I, uh...
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
True.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
He's such a loser!
Well, how about this?
Singing?
Really?
You know.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
I hope.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Well-well, like what?
How?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Well--
No!
I remember you.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
I'm fine.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Right.
Yeah.
Hi.  How you doin'?
When'd you get here?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Uh-huh.
They're offering... 
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a growth business.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
...why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Who would that be.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
...would you excuse me...?
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
That's why my wife adores me.
Somewhere in Italy.
You give me whatever I want...?
...they're from Baltimore....
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Try Barney Clark.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Yes, I did.
I can make you rich.
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
A wonderful country...
That, that was <u>business</u>...
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
I have had the honor. 
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! 
...not to turn around.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
...<u>what</u>...?
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...what do you expect me to...
I know where he is.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
...yes...?
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
What are you gonna do about it?
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...

The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Do you really think I care?
Shut the fuck--!
It's not my style, okay?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Oh yeah, that's it.
No. Hell no.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Heather? Wha...
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Yeah, I just got back.
Suicide is a private thing.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
Killing her won't solve anything.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Good plan.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
Did to.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
No-o!
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
But my name's not...
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
It doesn't matter.
He . . .
Him . . .
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
That idiot boarder?
You mean travel by ourselves?
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
All right, then.
I'm all over it.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Just get better okay?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Gwen.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
What?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
I surrender...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You.
It's getting hot in here.
WHAT?!
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I got your bail continued.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Spanish kinda guys!
I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
You do?
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
LaPlante!
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
How are they with kids?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
What toys do you have?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Aw, okay.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
I've asked him what's wrong.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
There's no card or anything.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
What?
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
It's fun.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Tough.
He had to come from somewhere.
It's circumstantial.
Is that it?
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
What worries you?
You.
No -- I will.
No -- after you.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
Sometimes.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
About what?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Sorry.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
I've seen it.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
I like my work.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Fine.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
I'm here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Give up.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
I overheard him with the girl.
You have his address?
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
You fucked up, Glen.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
Where is it?
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
I still see that boy's eyes.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
What I want is to help my father.
How about dog shit?
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
How about you and your sister?
No!  They're right here --
How do I reach him?
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
These disks . . . where are they?
I guess we do.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Of course.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Of course.
Six.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
What did they say?
The front gate would be best, General.
No.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
What is it?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Show me your ID
I will see what I can do.
Move? Where to?
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Please, be quiet.
I couldn't help.
They do not have your connections.
Murdered! By whom?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
So where is the lamb?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
What?
What sort of plan?
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Why?
The lieutenant wants the register.
Thank you, sir.
As the trucks go.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- bullshit --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Three times, to be exact.
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Yeah, me too.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What?
Take the gun.
I'm better than that.
There's always exceptions.
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
Let's try down here...
It's succeeding!
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Where is she?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
What?
What're you talking about?
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I'll take my chances.
Please! I need your help.
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
He must've unsealed the room!
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
What will they tell you?
How's your arm?
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
We'll get it later.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Well, that all depends.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
A friend?
What's happening!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
And you...are?
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
It will not take long...
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
We'll be there.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And what did you discover?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Right.  Right!
Oh yeah ...
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Did you know him?
I'll do it!
And he still sits there?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Would you know this store again?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
A prize?  For what?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
You sound disappointed.
Yes way.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Ooh-kay...
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Prison?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Baseball, why?
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Snappy.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Yeah.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
...Why don't I just type this up...
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Smitty.
...You do?
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Never mind about that...
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
This you're familia' with.
But, buddy --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Geez, I --
I --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
The mark notices.
He don't look wise.
Hello, Niagara.
He notices.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
At the Houmfort.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
But it's so far away...
That's rather nice, isn't it?
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
But she's not dead, Wes.
You didn't drive her mad.
I told you.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
To the asylum?
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Gotcha.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Rough day. Good night.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
Don't be dim.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
It's a starting place.
In the car.
Ben.
Yeah.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
In a bit.
I just can't believe you could be so --
Nah.
Yeah.
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
It was all junk!
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
It'll warm you up.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Educated guess.
But not too ashamed.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Sure.  Twinkie?
I'm chewing.
Then why'd you come after me?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
All my model planes.
Yeah.
Communist Viet Cong.
You never tasted the stuff?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Too bad...
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
He would have liked that.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
He's just rattling your cage.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
What did he look like?
You're not missing much.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Oh?
Yes down at the station.
But you wanted to.
Yes.
No back-up.
Nothing if not vampires...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
No, my beloved, my child.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
What plans?
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Claudia - don't -
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Still my beautiful child.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
So you felt it too!
But if she dies...
I want it!
You've just done it -
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
You have fed. You were made for this...
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Fascination...
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
I don't pretend to know.
I know. Let her alone.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
Lestat, what do you mean?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
That's all past, Lestat.
And they frighten you?
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
It's just a room...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
It's over, I'm telling you...
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
A child who can't die...
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
Yet. Nothing yet.
No means yes.
Okay, okay. You're right.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Yes.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Come on, you can make it.
Ray, we're just friend.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
This weekend?
Never do that again.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Who?
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
What?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Did you get help?
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Why?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Well ——
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
Good winds and bad winds!
Thank you.
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
She has never mentioned her family.
How old is she?
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Whet do you mean?
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Wouldn't I?
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
Her name is Thea?
I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
I can't understand that.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
I can't.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Yeah, very funny.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
No, of course not.
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
I'm not supposed to tell.
Where is she?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Oh, wonderful!
That's your problem, George Bailey.
A boy?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hi, Bert.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Mother . . .
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Oh, George.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Huh?
Some other time, George.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
About what?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
Yeah, just started.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
You have no idea what happened . . .
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
You forgot something.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
I want to go faster!
They're moving pretty fast.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
Yee-hah!
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
We're hung up on something.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Want to swim home?
Anyone got another set of sails?
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Is that what it is?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
What shark?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Is there one in these waters?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
MMMmmmorning....
So's a donut.
One what?  Ah-ha!
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Do you?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Just one minute....
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Two of them are still missing!
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
What?
That's you.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
That's a crock of shit.
Anything?
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Yeah.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Yeah.  Down there.
See you later.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Not enough loving.
Nothing.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Here.
Yes?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Recovering nicely.
Me, too.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Hydrophobia...
Michael, you're not going down there.
I'm  fine.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Yes, aren't we all.
No, no.  That won't do.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
Still sleeping.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Sure.
How long you staying?
How come?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Goes up.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Five hundred yards.
It's not closing, Mike.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Got a job for me?
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Don't bother Hoagie....
But you always let me....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
He was doing his job....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Because....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
I have work....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
I'm not on vacation....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Mommy lets me....
I didn't.
Dad died from a heart attack....
Good.  So will I....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No, you're not....
No!
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
Just like that?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Get her started....
Oh, boy....
You didn't stick them on right....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
They won't fight with me....
I didn't do it on purpose....
They put bombs on dolphins....
What?
What do you know about him?
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
I didn't ask you to....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
I don't like the song.
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
Jake.
Here it comes....
I told you....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
Someone bet me a dollar ..
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Then give me that Zippo.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
Car accident.
Sure.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
That's bullshit,
And did they?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Why not? You heard my voice?
Yes.
Of course I would ..
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Ross told me.
Just your age.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
A derelict.
Ugh!
That's right.
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
-- stop --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Still going.
Wait.  What do you mean?
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Bill, Rod, wait --
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Oh tsht. Yes.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
No no, I know --
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Mission... statement...
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
I'm relieved you said that.
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
You want...
I think we made a mistake here.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yes.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
That's your word?
No, I air-dry.
No tell me. _ 84.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Gorgeous.
Oh no -- _ 14.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
Jerry --
-- and I'll get 'em.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
I'm scared.  What is it?
Can you be quiet?
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
One way to find out.
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Eric...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
When did you have it last?
You mean it?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Here!
then we should...
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
NO!
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
On the island.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
You should.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Minimal.
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
I want to see the nesting ground!
Not without a shot of the nest.
Which one?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Funded by whom?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
You think this is all a joke?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
Where did the vehicles stop?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Uh - - about two million.
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Six weeks?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Why?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
I know.
Yeah, I know.
- - a gizzard - -
Like hell it is!
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
He sends his apologies.
In a box under my seat.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
I doubt it.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
You got me.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Nope.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Yeah, they hate me.
No.
I didn't say I was scared.
Relatively.
We gotta do something.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Who?
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
You're a beautiful big animal.
Please!
Yes.
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
John, John.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Thanks, Dad.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Excellent.
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
What about that other guy?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
None of that's true?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
How do we prove it?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
Cute waitresses?
Me too. I'm drunk.
Fascinating.
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn't make sense.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
What was the matter with it?
-- Small.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
I'll commit that to memory.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
What?
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I -- I found your jailer.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We know that.
... Just a perception.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
Ludwig?
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
I photographed it extensively, father.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Jack!...  Jack!
Two... maybe three.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Uh uh.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
Please --
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Why?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
My bed.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Right back at the start, right?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
I called Trina.
How do you know how bad it was?
You're going back?
Mm.
I am.
I believed her, Pete.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
No.
What else do you know?
Nobody's seen that.
Yes sir, we know he --
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
You got a letter from mom.
Yeah?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I hate it.
No.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
No, I did not.
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
No.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
I'm not taking him with me.
What?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
What?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Are you firing me, Jim?
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
It's going to cost.
Ten.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Got it.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Please, Thel...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
No.
Here. We'll collect them.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I miss my brother.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Please.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Always.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You decide.
Does he have the spot?
The Chinese.
Ahh.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Does he treat you fairly?
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
I need to see his habitat.
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
They don't really attack underwater and--
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
So profound and fat.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
What's going on?
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Oh, bullshit.
No.
They could try to tranq him on land.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
What?
Who?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Good.  See ya soon.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Yes.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I thought I saw...
Hector thinks you like him.
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
She's worried about the cow now.
I want you to go there.
Part of our research--
You're all right! Where is he?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
Why not?
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But if he knew we have so little time -
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Did you ever work with her?
I am, yes.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Ahhh... Why?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Who killed your patient?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Mmm. And what else...?
The death of my father.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
You know I can't make that promise.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Fort Edward, then?
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
That is sedition! Treason!
Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Your enemy...
Will you men help us stop the French?
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Fire!!!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Granted.
Be my guest.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
How's TransOcean doing?
...and a Russian grandmother...
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
Under there?
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Two hundred meters.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
What are you going to do to him?
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Right.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Seven hundred for the pair.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
You had better be careful.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Furry muff, let's go.
Er well, yes we do.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Out the back.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Why, what's up?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I will loan you the money.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I'll only be a minute.
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
What about all the gear?
How many wings have they got between them?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
--you're going to be on your own.
They stole our land--
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
No, sir. Not at all.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Yes, Sergeant.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Charley Wade.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
So is Buddy on your short list?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
Same weight I always was.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Uncle Al--
I'm a colonel.
No sir.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
Substance abuse?
And people make their choice--
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Eladio Cruz.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
That's a matter of interpretation--
Right.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Thank you.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
What about it?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
For a while.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Got him here?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
The shooter local?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Sure.
Another woman?
Otis what?
Why you think that was?
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Why would I do that?
He's a priest?
About?
I could scoop them out.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
Why not?
When do you want me to start?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
You said you weren't with him for love.
Yes.
Hang on!
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
...yes?
Yes.
I... have... to.
... they believe you.
Sure.
Oh God.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I'd like to hear them.
It's one in the afternoon.
Mine.
I saw him in Vegas once.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
You want more money, is that it?
Yes.
Shit...
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Well... nobody.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
I don't know what else to do.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Yes.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Can you do it?
Try.
Who is she?
What about Philip Swann?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Not true.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Oh.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
I know. I don't either.
Oh, for her show?
That's ok.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
No, we'll find something around here.
Hi, Bob.
I don't think so.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Fine.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Yes.  It's exactly...
No, I wasn't, actually.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
He spoke to you?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Miette, come here and relax.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
You should think about getting professional help.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
When's your birthday?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
What about after?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Maya?  What do you mean?
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Where is she now?
That's not it.
That's ridiculous.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
She's alright.
What'd you do?
You're a caterer?
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You want the job or not?
Huh?
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Yes, we appreciate that.
What?
Four days.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
You do.
They ever love you back?
Chances are there's still a chance.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I was just playing ball.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
Kay.
Who's Spalding?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Then prove her wrong.
What are we playing for?
What?
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
What's up?
Are you out of your mind?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
You forgot to be there.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
A rest?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Wow.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
He tore his ACL.
You hearing me?
Later when?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
This is just about money, you know that.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
I just told you.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
After five years.
Yeah.
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
Hello, Phil.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Sure is.  So why call me?
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
Thank you.
What's that stand for?
You wanna go on a date with me?
Please, yes.
Yeah.
It's my favorite place --
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
It's fine.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
That was so great what you just said.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
What?
Just say no.
You alone in there?
It doesn't matter.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
-- no.
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
That's confidential information, little man.
-- and I'm through playin' games.
What's up?
Is it real love?
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
Brad, dear?
I'm sick.
That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE.
Gently, son --
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
He has Phil right now.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Yeah.
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
I think you have the wrong number.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
Are you close?
...this close...
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
Mmm.
You can't just come in here.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
No.  No.
Yeah.
Who?
Two years...three years...
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Did you ever touch her?
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
You should know better.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Yes. What? Yes.
It's ok.
M'lady...?
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
No, Louis!  No!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
And people close to him, who --
Three days??!!
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Why didn't you say so?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Athos, my friend!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
Oh my friend.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Phillippe.  Rest now.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
... The ball... Continue.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
You may go, Lieutenant.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
... Nothing.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you think?
I didn't hit shit!
Fine...
Gotta come from somewhere...
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Yeah?
He said he was following up some lead.
Who is it?
No...
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Where the hell is my car?
I killed them.
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Where is he?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
I don't recommend it.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Christ!
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
'You're very beautiful.
I have to.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Why?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Tell me now.
How do I know?!
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
This is our boy...!
It's happening again, Jack...
When do you need it?
I'm fine.
I'm fine, Francis.
Are you okay...?
Yes.
The Tooth...
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.
Uh... sure...
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
I don't understand.
That's true.
'Intimate? !"
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Tell me about yourself.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
And... where are things?
Mama was probably asleep.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Yes. Is Molly there?
Tell her I called.
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Yes.
How?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Pray tell.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
I don't have one right now.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
There'll be other shots.
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
I don't wanna talk about it!
No thanks.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
I can shtop whenever I want...
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
And you are?
Oh shit.
The orders were for your protection.
Oh, God.
I know.  It's her fault.
You don't, do you?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
No!
Really?
How?
Any time.
Cypher?
I got you.
Yes.
How?!
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
The Matrix?
This can't be...
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Your training.
The body cannot live without the mind.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
That I would find the One.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
I need the main wet-wall.
We're on our way --
Honestly?  I don't know.
Who are you?
What?
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I believe I can bring him back.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Tank, it's me.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Let go of her.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
You got sparklers?
You sure?
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
'Thou art then a king?'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Nervous?
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
Mind your own business.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Get him in.
We'll be here.
Fine.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Hostess?
Yes, you did.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Charlie...?
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
I know...I know.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Friends of yours Michael.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
A name?
What will I tell Annie?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Cold.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
What do you mean?
Glad I could be of some help.
Sit down, Drew.
How nice for you both.
I don't care.
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
Thanks, Quince.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Make it go 'way.
Yes.
Mine, too.
Rass!
It's so very nice to see you again.
I didn't know that.
Watch me do what?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Yes.
Why don't you get off his case?
I said get out.
-- I guess you haven't.
Why, yes.  Thank you.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
How beautiful.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
I love you in an evening gown.
-- Yes?
How long have I got?
I guess so.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Yes, Bill.
What's it like where I'm going?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
It's all yours.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
And I don't give a shit.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Then what is it?
So that's what love is?
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
An indictable offense.
You fill the bill, Bill.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Sure.
Yes, I believe I do.
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
We're all ears.
I am.  With you.
That's all?
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Where's he going?
You and 'Honey'?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
That's it?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Interested in buying one?
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Strip!
I don't want your fucking money!
Tell me about her again.
Why?
I wasn't helping you for money.
You know what we have in common?
Your wife?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
And what did he say?
Somebody's come. Already.
How?
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Can I ask you something?
Sweet.
How do you know about me?
Did Teddy send you?
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You're in a playful mood.
Why?
Teddy. Your buddy.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
But he's not the right guy!					  *
No. You took them out.						  *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Turn around.
"And" what?
Oh, yeah...
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Two main players plus three.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Where's she now?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Is this the protective male talk?
I'll be on board by noon.
No.
What kind of weight?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Chill out Sonny.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Then you should.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
What are you talking about?
Where's Riccardo?
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes.  What's up?
...and thanks for the flowers.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
No, ma'am, I'm not.
For what?
For money for what?
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
What of?
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
What you got me up here for?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
What?
Don't make me laugh.
Ziat!
Stop shitting me, man!
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
About ten kilometers.
Not far. Just a little way.
How much?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Beats working.
Hello.
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Get the... midnight... express.
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
Cut his fucking throat.
Max - where?
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Shit.
Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Just do it!
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
What?
Manny...
You did!
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
How?!
It worked before...
Just like Trump Tower, then.
What?
Anything you can tell me might help.
Sure.
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
No, what is it?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I'm getting to believe you.
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
The what?
Yeah, yeah...
...have to wait.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
He's your client, huh?
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
Buster.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Did they win?
Well that depends.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Mmmm.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
I hope there's a place to land.
I am. She is.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Care to wait a decent interval?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Just like old times?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Why did you phrase it like that?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
I don't.  No exactly.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
She must still be on the property.
Do I?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Krieger.
Sleeping's better.
There was nobody on the bridge.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Are you damaged?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Why was there another team?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
On what?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
What about Job?
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I'm willing to take the chance.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
I guess.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
- and picked us up in the States -
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
And get a doctor.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Jack you're so wicked.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Twenty minutes.
No, I'm going.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Yes.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
He did?
Yeah.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
It's temporary.
I got it done.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
What?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I'm in love with you!
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Yeah.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
I think that's it.
I wanna go home.
We're here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Maybe you're right.
Bobo, take the cart away.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Yes, on the floor.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
He's my younger brother.
If I marry you my mother will die.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
He should pay.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's incredible.
Yes.
Okay, I'll tell her.
It was a miracle!
Sure!
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Don't shit where you eat.
I think it's because they fear death.
Sure.
Yes.
Good night.
Marriage is happy news.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You see that moon last night?
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
You're using coconuts!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
I'm not interested.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
I am your king!
NI!
All right!  What do you want?
One that looks nice.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
No, no ... not "is"!
I move for no man.
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Had enough?
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Ni, ni, ni!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
Follow!
It is the rabbit.
What?
Charge!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
What is your favorite colour?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Ninepence.
I can't take him.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Rather what?
Sir Galahad!!
No, It's nothing!
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
They're doctors?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I'm sorry, I must go.
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Shut up.
What?
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Aye, but will they?
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You know nothing about her!
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Of course.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
By whose authority?
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
Aye, do.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Occasionally.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
See what?
They aren't as watchful as you.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Ah, well...
To keep out the cold.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am.
Well, both.
You can't know that for sure.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Of course.
The same, your Majesty.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Why was I not told earlier?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
What is it?
Yeah, who isn't.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
My house.  I want to try something.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
There...
I don't want to talk about it.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Not yet, honey...
The Cowboy??
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
There is no problem.
Yeah.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Okay, I'm thinking.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Good luck, honey!
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Oh...
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Not that I can see.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
No.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
You see what I mean...
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
The one of 'em still alive?
Palmdale.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
Sure.
No one has a gun to your head.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
We drown.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Okay.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Yes.
That's a shame.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
A dragon.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
What ?
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Excuse me, sir ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
I'm listening.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
We can't afford too many surprises.
I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
I meant him.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
What ?
Nothing.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
I don't even know your name.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Totally.
I will. How's Shelly?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
We have a baby?
How about a nice glass of milk?
You're being narrow-minded.
I'd like to, thanks.
I'll try.
I've got something better.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
ehh...I don't know I mean....
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
My mother.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
He is one of the great poets.
...I dropped it.
Leave me alone!!
Good. I mean...
Wow!
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
A secret, I like that.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
What?
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
What do you mean??
I'm sure she will.
No kidding?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
What happened to her?
Okay.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Sorry.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
No, sweetie, not yet.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
I'm very nervous.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh come on.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Thomas?
What are they about?
Okay.
No.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Uh huh, why?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
They're just fun to read.
Hurry!
I'm trying.
It's a mosquito bite.
Sorry.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
What?
So?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
The wandering sportswriter.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
The man you love.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
And what will he do?
You need a few dollars.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
He said that, too.
... except one.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Exactly.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
It doesn't say th...
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Nobody has.  So far.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
This is where I proposed.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
What did you say your name was?
Bye, Bye.
Okay. Thanks.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
He's going to run for president.
Suits me.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Well, he's really amazing.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Get in.
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Sixty-three.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
No, I don't.
I'm here.
Wow!
Wrong.
I'm not sure.
Thirty?
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
I'm not sure...
What?
Fifteen minutes?
Glad to meet you.
For him?
Sleeping.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Where are you from?
Ryan O'Neal.
You think I should take lessons?
You serious?
May I see your costume?
Yes, they were.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
How's it goin'?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Aside from the obvious?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Rockin'!
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Slate it.
But you'll never be whole again.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Ya know, I was.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
And me.
Want me to come?
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
I don't know.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Yeah. On the section gang.
I'm a teacher.
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
That's right.
Go on - you can have one!
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Take it easy.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Well, what d'you think?
Don't call them that.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
I don't want to hurt you.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
We can always do that, Duff.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
I'm Duff.
Okay.
Okay.
How often is that?
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
It's for your own good.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I know.
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Anything you say, baby.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
Can you read my mind?
Are you even really alive?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Yeah.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Why should I want to meet him.
What about before that?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Too late?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
What went down between you and Riviera?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Nice.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Petty good.
It is?
Yes, it's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
I'm late for lab.
Oh. I forgot.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Nope.
If you say so.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Why?
Uhh, no.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Hey. There.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
My sword.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
See!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I can't do this.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
You're twenty-three years old!
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
You like her?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
To put us back together again when we fall.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
Why?
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Who are you guys?
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
I know.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
It's getting there.
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Naw. Just killing time.
What the hell are you talking about?
Yeah.
Yeah?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What's this?
What do you mean?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Why won't you talk to me?
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Eggs?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
Okay...thanks.
I'm serious.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
I had such an awful dream.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Watching TV.
Jennifer --
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
To old friends.
Do you still...see each other?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
What?
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Fuck off.
Restless.  Very restless.
Thanks, Max.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Of course.
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Oh, stop showing off.
I'm not listening.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Fifteen million dollars.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh right.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Yes.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Busy tomorrow?
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Why?
Your boyfriend?
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Is that right?
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Da Vinci?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
What's your name?
Can I help you?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
So -- any messages?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
Yes.
What?
The one down your trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
Y-y-y-yes...
No! No! No!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
B-B-Billy.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
O-o-o-oh...
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
C-C-C-C-Candy!
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
No.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Hey, what's that?
Shhh...
Me too...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Just warmin' up.
What for?
I'm busting outta this place.
No!
What's this?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
He's not!
Poker!
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
You bet, Doc!
I'm afraid not.
All I'm askin' is...
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
'Kay...
Okay. How you doing?
To help you relax... please...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Tha's your problem.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
Oh, yeah...
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Buona notte.
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
No...
Except possibly that.
Dwayne?
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Sa dov'e' lui?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
No.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
But, Faith--
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Hm.
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
That was before I found out what it was.
Yes.
So it wasn't real.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh.  That's nice.
Nice dress.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
No.  Course not.
I know the feeling.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
GET OUT!!
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Tonight?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Is he gay?
You don't have any idea?
Why don't you ask him?
I know...  It was.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
Only, it's in Italian...
Larry bought himself cologne?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
I never even got to be single.
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
What?
And then what, Faith?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Is Damon Bradley here?
What if he doesn't like me?
No one's perfect, Kate.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Sorry...
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Maybe.
Don't say that!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Hello, Edie.
Terry... Terry... .
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
I'm with Terry.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
In braids? That's right.
How do you like it?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
But a priest...?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
But that's living like an animal—
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
Terry, what's wrong?
Edie— it's—
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you've got to listen to me.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
This is my business.
But you still hold out for silence?
What?
I think you could have.
You'd be off the pier for good.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
I'll see you on the roof.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Gimme.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Aw, Johnny... .
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Yes I feel it in my bones.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Of course I do.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
As you wish, Master
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
He didn't want me to.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
You were his what, his box?
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Whatta you wanna do?
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
It was an unusual experience.
I have to qualify, is that it?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You're gonna use a ram?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
No, I didn't know that.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
There a problem, Foley?
Yeah.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Because you're having too much fun.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Don't leave me.
It smelled.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
You believe that?
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Any time.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The next time I walk into a bank.
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
What-- when?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
You're not my type.
What did you call it?
It's a --
What'd I say?
So?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
I don't have any idea.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Foley's got it.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Land of the free...
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
So what are you saying?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
I got a half a tank.  You?
Little less.
Yes you can.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
You were more like brothers.
...He said that?
Well...sure.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Thank you, Sir.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Boxin'.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
You too, Lieutenant.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
That's disgusting!
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
Why wait?
They'll learn to live with it.
Thanks.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Come on, let's dance.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
What am I going to do with you?
Let's go down to the basement.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
How'd you know about that?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
What?
I've got to go now.
I'm trying.
I'll just set it right here.
Then hold me.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
What would that be, sir?
Touchy, touchy!
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
But I'm remembering the future.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
It must run in the family.
What're you doing here anyway?
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
What a treat.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
This morning was good.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I'm just happy to see you.
Rosalie Testa!
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
Come on. You can't be serious.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
It sucked.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Why not?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Andy?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I promise!
Maybe you should think about it.
Of course.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Sounds delightful.
Uh, yeah.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
We?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
I've considered that.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
I suppose you could say that.
Yes.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
No. I can't really see it.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Thank you. No more questions.
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Not especially.
Duh...
That's perfectly clear.
My lettuce is wilting.
Why should I?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Had it with deals.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Think about what?
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Don't do this to me....
I would try for them.
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
Not sure. Ten?
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Hey, who?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Probably right.
What?
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
How many?
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Smoke screen for what?
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Frightening thought.
And pointless.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About the girl.
What do you care?
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
What, it's broken?
I apologize.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Do you have any weapons?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
It's probably wrong --
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Yo!
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.
He's trying to form words.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Do as I say.
We're here to stay.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Climb off me, will you!
Try telling them our names.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Read it yourself.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Then you admit --
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
But there's the doll, sir.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Fuck you bitch.
Shaddup bitch.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Barnes comes from Hell.
Over here!
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Dawn...
...beautiful night.
Nah...
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
He dugged his own grave.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
You don't know.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
I see.
Nice of him.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
No thanks.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Dance? Tonight?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
Killaine's wise to what?
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
No.  I paid him off.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Mitchell was dead enough.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Where's you get it?
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
There isn't anything you can do.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
To do what?
What will they do to you?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
Goodbye, Betty.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
You, Killaine?
So you're not a cop.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
A private joke.
How's life treating you?
The usual grind.
I don't.
Well--good night.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Mr. Mitchell.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
That's not enough.
With what motive?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
Men like you don't need orders.
What do I get for it?
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Pretty big chance, huh?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
How about Magruder?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
But you still think she's innocent.
Who's the girl?
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
You already have the checks, darling.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Thanks.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
I see.
Freshman and sophomores...
I couldn't bear for it to end.
How nice.
And the Argies.
It's shit.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
You're so gross.
The torture of small children--
I'll ring you.
Fuck off.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Okay, I will.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
Yes, you said.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
She said that?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Oh no!
You'd look naked without one.
Promise.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Sir?
I take the skin off chicken.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
NOOO!!
I'm serious.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
What are you talking about?
You're kneeling on my hand.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Go on.
What story did you give to Davis?
I saw it.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Please, we hardly know each other.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
What's that?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
The price just went up to ten.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
For an hour.
You know how to drive a stick?
Exactly.
Do you plan everything?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Occupational hazard?
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No?  Why's that?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
I got a dress, yeah.
The Rex.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Why not?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Shall we mingle?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
But don't they have it in English?
I've never treated you like a whore.
You just did.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
All this because of that whore!
Yes.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Go for the bucks.
Do I!?  Momma!
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
You're a guest here?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
But what if they serve soup?
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
I just might do that.
Brides often are, I'm told.
He knows I do not love him.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Who's Guilder?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
I have a little.
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
I hope we win...
Has it got any sports in it?
Because I can stop now if you want.
Who gets Humperdinck?
DEATH FIRST!!
No.  To the pain.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
-- offer me money --
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
I ought to be after twenty years.
I am not left-handed either.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
That would be inconceivable.
Oh, have it your way.
Yes.
Good. Then pour the wine.
A little bit.
Maybe he won't.
Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
"To my honey I'll croon,
Oooooooops!
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Maybe you're happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Who wrote it?
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Do you think he'll take the job?
Only if we ask him.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
What is it?
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Nice girl.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
People can hear you.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No.
No one met her?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
How did she pay you?
And when she left, she never came back.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Anyone at home?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Who are you, friend?
How much?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Sure...
Is Mary here?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Where's the old highway?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Sam, I'm going.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
I believe it.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Sam. This is the last time.
Sam! No!
I'll lick the stamps.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
I have?
I'd like to.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
To a private island, like you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Norman.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright, Miss... 
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Norman took a wife?
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Leave me alone!
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
I don't know--I can't tell--
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Well, news of Buckley?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Go to sleep!
That spoke to you?
You lie!
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Horsefeathers!
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Excuse me???
Yes....
Where to?
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
In what sense were they bad?
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
You're my sweetheart.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
You won't die, Rose.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
What was your mother like?
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
What's taking the rascal so long?
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing, Doll?
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Here comes Daddy.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Go on, Doctor.
I think we both know her.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I am not being brutal to her!
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
He's a polecat, dear.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
Well, it's Billy.
Well. What kinda job is it?
Mine.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Galley proof.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Incestuous.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Abe Lincoln...
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
That wasn't my fault.
We should slow down.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
The booze.
Dean Martin.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Speak for yourself.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
There probably is.
Well, sir...
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Dead.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Gimmie a minute.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
It's one of a kind.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't kill my own father.
Yoda spoke of another.
I can't see.
Wouldn't miss it.
All set.
That's all any of us can see.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Come on! Come on!
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
We shall double our efforts.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
I will not fight you, father.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
Never-r-r!
Yes.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
How many languages do you speak?
Certainly not!
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Yes.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Oh.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
It's okay.
I should leave.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
'Bout seven.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Give my main man a raise!!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Get that doctor.
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Does that bum have to say that?
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What about for food an' stuff?
...Fine.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
No action.
Mr. Balboa --
I'm sure you are.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
...Screw you, yoyo.
...Yeah.
Maybe I like garbage.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Ya, somethin' like that.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
...Tomato?
More like thirty.
Did ya win?
Rice is a bum.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
...What?
Ya got a good mind for dates.
Whatta you get outta this?
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
...Yeah.
It ain't your locker no more.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
It don't matter.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Sounds like singin'.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Why didn't you tell me?
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
A joker to the end.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Divorce?  Never!
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
I think you oughta read it to her.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Uh? Uh?
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
But 'tis no wit to go.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Art thou hurt?
'Tis he.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
From Interpol?
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Next.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
You'll die if you leave here.
I don't have it with me...
I swear...
Then where is it?
A post office box.
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
And you respect him.
Of course.  Don't you?
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Did he bring that with him?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who else would you be?
Things.  This is my country, you know.
As in, they own it?
What's the difference?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
I know of him.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
It is at that.
I never made that claim.
You think?
I don't know...
No you don't, and you know it.
Because I don't walk away.
Closest and oldest.
And now...
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
I'm sure.
I'm alright.  And you?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I can't get enough of it.
I hear you.
Shit, more than that.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Well someone's gonna find them.
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
How much?
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Heard you had quite a night.
Nothing.
That son of a bitch.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
How the hell did he find it?
I know.
I love you Sally.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Well I don't know...
Sure.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Sort of.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
Right behind you.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
We're going to find out.
I'm not getting an answer.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Two-hundred thousand!
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Bathroom.
I'm sorry.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
No.  She's a school teacher.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
You sound like that all the time.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
Gimme the binoculars.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
What?
She never even looked at you.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
Now that I believe.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Dancing?
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
The Secret Service?  Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Ricky Tan?
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Tell me about it.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
That silly-ass look on your face.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
You know War?
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
They put you in charge?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Carter, can I have a moment?
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Thanks.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
No, she's talking about your hair.
That must have made you proud.
Thank you.
Yes.
You have one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Highly suspect.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
That's called changing your mind.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No.
That's good.
He's got a houseboat.
What is it?
And then I'll see you in New York --
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I should say something in this about magic.
I always wondered about that too.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I know.
I know. 
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Are his folks nice?
Like... clockwork.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
The cabinets have to be redone --
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
You want me to talk to him?
Yeah.
Fair enough.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Do you want a fruit plate?
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What?
Good.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
There she is.
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Victoria? She's okay.
Shut up.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
Okay.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
You're kidding --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
He's good at it.
Sure.  Sure.
Whose side are you on anyway?
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
An American.
No, Estellita.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Aaah, what's the use?
No, no ...
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Over my dead body.
Yes.
I've had them since the day they were born.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Will you be still?
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You mind?
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
How about in the house?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Nothing.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Then leave.
Like you?
How much time do you have?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Why?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
What?
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
You don't say.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
Crank or glass?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Jesus.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
The Mexicali Boys
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
And you've got wiener breath.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't worry about it.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
A private, sir?
No kidding.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
You must be a hell a shot.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
A half-track, anything.
It was nothing.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Beasley's dead.
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
How about you shut up and take your position?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
I know.
Yes, sir.
What are we going to do?
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Yeah, how so?
There's always a bright side.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Yes, sir.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
Yeah?  So?
Because he's guilty.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Please?
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
I already did.
Read it.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
Alright.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
I'm fine.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Honey!
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Yes, I...
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Yeah
No.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Twisted?
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Mmmm.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Friends with potential.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Yeah.
No.
I don't think so.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
Say what?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Is this because of your dad?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Good to know.
Okay.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Hello Lloyd.
Fine Lloyd.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Your car?
You know Diane Court?
Alright!
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
It's good business.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
You asked for shoe polish.
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
How do you do?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
And killing.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
They're withholding payment.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
You'll lose money.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
There will be generations because of what you did.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
What now?
That doesn't work, sir.
On national television.
What is it?
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
Don't forget to set the alarm.
I did that.
Did you do it?
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And are the police sure about that?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
I think it's out of your control.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
No. This is a set up.
So we found a compromise.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Hallie?
Over here.
No, wait here.
Yeah, right.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
I'm everywhere.
It's what you want from me.
It's good to see you involved.
But who would operate your camera?
I don’t know.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Thanks, Joel.
But...
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Shush.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Thanks.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
What did you know about your mother?
Catch him, or kill him.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
The killer called her.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
And who is that?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Who is it?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What the hell are you doing?
None.
That's funny.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Huh, fine.
Roman that's not the line.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Duh... that's quick.
Where the fuck did she go?
You sleep in THAT?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Yeah... I think so.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
It happens. Take it easy.
So why did you dial it again?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?
Uh-huh.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Don't hang up on me.
To talk.
They'd never make it in time.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Why are you doing this?
NOOOO....
No it's not. It was Jason.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
Shit.
I don't know. I guess.
What about the cellular phone bill?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
It'll be out later this year.
Just stay back.
Do you still think he's innocent?
Has his story changed?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
I heard screaming.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Twice.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Thanks, Tatum.
I'm not worried.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Thank you.
It would be too hard.
What?  What?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Okay...
And, why is that?
It's close.
What the fuck is going on?
I... I don't follow.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
No one yet.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
What about them?
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Nothing.
Bullshit.
The fingerprints.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
Call an ambulance.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Are you absolutely certain?
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
I don't know...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
Just keep goin'...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
I've come now...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Good night.
Oh...
He just couldn't wait...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
No...not yet...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
From the beginning...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
I got to fetch her home...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
I haven't the slightest idea.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You don't remember?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Tenth floor.
Oh
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
When I have fifty pounds.
Romeo
No, your marriage bed.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Good title.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
it will be all right, madam.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
As soon as I have found my muse
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Ethel.
When the Queen commands it.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"Madam!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"Ay me."
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
I like her.
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
I have to get back.
Can you love a player?
Oh
And that was only my first try.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You never spoke so well of him.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Virginia?!
Your aunt?
She sings too?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
What?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
I'm only asking what you think.
No.
He couldn't get his car started.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Is this necessary?
You think so?
How much?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I don't know anything about it.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Just serve.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
-- which is a hack.
His car's still there.
What sort of car?
So?
Yes.
Did what?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
What? What's wrong?
No.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
I thought we all were.
Are you all right?
Don't you?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
David?
Forget it.
We could put it somewhere.
Alex.
What about?
Of course.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Sorry?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
I'm not sure --
What happened to that guy?
That guy, the one that died.
You must be Juliet.
Writing seems easy.
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
Diseases.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Why?
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
Gee, that's very serious...
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
But you don't know what happened.
Calm down, baby.
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What about?
Yes.
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
No, I know.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Nobody can hear it.
Are you?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
No.
Right.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Great... so how's everything with you?
Well, I do.
Can't you do it out here?
Yeah, I think so...
Great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
It's hot in here.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Yeah?
He's a director.
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
He still having parties?
-- ass and legs --
Lester's on his way.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
So I'm saying it...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
No shit?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Great.
Could I talk to you for a second?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Whether or not I'm going.
I'll call you.
Where's your car?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Let go of me.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
I see.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Sure.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Oh Jesus Christ.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to wash one out.
Lester, it just happened.
No --
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
No you won't.
A soap?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
That's right.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Well, it's George.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Honey?
-- He reached up and tore them.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Sure.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
That's fine --
Everybody but us.
They had to, in order to survive.
Good.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
No.
I won't make any noise.
Are you having a bad dream?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
All right, sir.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Yes.
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
I'm not going to hurt you.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Oh, I'll say.
Hi.
Jesus.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Will you?
Jane-
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
There! You see!
I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What?
What?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Yes?
Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
Oh my! 
You betcha.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
Pay attention...
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
You know that song?
Um, I don't really know this one...
Five a.m.?
Three years.  Sister.
Three years.  A rookie.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Excuse me?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Very well.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Your cell.  Your room.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
What?
Oh?
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
You won't even tell us?
Yeah...
Maybe pants.
That's what I figured, too.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
Christy.
I know. 
Find 'em!
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Two days... ?  For murder?
You must have missed your mark.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
I'm sure I don't know.
I hear nothing.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Must I hear this?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Just... keep where you are.
Come with me.
It was you there?
What did he say, Katrina?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
I do not know.  Away.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
I can show exactly.
What did you say?
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Good to know you, Karl.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
What you got that's good to eat?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Karl's my name.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Leave.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Would y'all like that?
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
I hate you!
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
I did live there in the state hospital.
Why'd you live there?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
How come?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Where'd you get them flowers?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
I don't reckon I know.
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
Yeah.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
Me, too.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I never was no good with history.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
We sure like havin' you.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Yes sir.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Where will he go?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Will he be supervised?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
But they're all the same.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
You usually get two.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
She probably died.
Yeah, probably.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Eighteen and a half years.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You what?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Why don't you open it and find out?
And you're giving it to me?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
So I can get my job back.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
I figured he had a right to know.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
And have you mended them?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
The what?
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
I don't know. For helping me out.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
And?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
The inspiration.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
A thousand.
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
You're implying th...
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Why?  We're only talking.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And why.  Is that?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Oh, yes.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Yes, he was.
To my father.  Everything counts.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe...?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Apparently.
I don't think so.
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
He had no reason to.
Such as?
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
What did he say?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Yeah.  Why?
We're not?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
- Type O.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
Done what?
Me?  After Sugar?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
With ME?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Jerry - there's another problem.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
We're not on the pier yet -
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
I'll say.
If there's anything I can do for you -
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
And you've got cold feet.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
When?
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Okay.
I met one of them.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Thirty-four.
Yes.  For a whole year.
What's with him - he drinks?
You don't say.
We'll adopt some.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
It's three weeks in Florida -
Because I got some plans -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Where did he conduct?
Have you ever been with a male band?
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Not at all.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
You're society girls?
- and always the same Four Hundred.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Guess!
I am?
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
It's the crews' night off.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I know.  Every time!
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
I already told you.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Thanks, Charlie.
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Actually, I do.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
What?
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
No, that’s not it.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
I don’t know.
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
A weekend?
Oh, no.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Show me.
I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Yup. That’s why you get to keep your money.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
Ahoy!
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Is he here in Borderdale?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yes, sir...
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
You bet we is!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
It's the heat.
Yes, ma'm...
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Well, let me have it.
I wanta get some things.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Whoops.
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Papa mama simi.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Yeah!
YOU BASTARD!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
What about air strikes?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Oh.
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Hello, Brooke Shields!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
That's nice, Stan.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Cool!
And ze rope?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Taylor, you surprise me.
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Over and out!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
But how are you going to escape?
You too.
So what's going to happen to you?
Sooner than later.
What do you mean?  What happened!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
That's affirmative.
I'm from Akron.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
No. I'm from Akron.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
When you get a chance.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Think he bought it?
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
100 years! 
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
The small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
You wish!
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
I found dad.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
You know who I am?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Line up where you want it.
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Where did your brother escape from?
What does he do?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Come on, bargain with me.
It?
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Fuck plan C!
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
Can you change something this big?
I'm looking for somebody.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Who identified the body?
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Two and a half days?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
A thousand feet.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Yes, Harry.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
I'm in charge.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Radiation shield, you think?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
Resetting the sub.
Wait -- down where?
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
Yeah, it was awful.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Beth.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
What?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think?
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
But how?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Three to six hours.
You think I'd really drink that?
I did do that, didn't I?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
No, he can't.
You think I manifested the snakes?
Someone did.
Shut up, Beth --
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
But I have to, Norman.
C'mon --
I never said that.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
You holding up alright?
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
No.  I didn't say that.
You don't understand about the sphere.
What is it, Harry?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Harry?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
How far away's the sub?
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Wait!
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
That's right.
But it's impossible.
Think about it.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
"We are friends".
Thank you.
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
Really?
What report?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Try this one.
The creature?
Unless it's an act.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
You mean I generate an energy field?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
You mean we should go after her!...
I'm not going alone!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Send one squad up.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
What are you saying?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
I think I did.
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
I read you sir.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Death to all bugs !
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Ace of spades.
I got Games & Theory.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
You and me, huh ?
You're upset, that's alright.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You got it.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
What's going on, Diz ?
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Give'em hell, sir !
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
A tractor beam...
Decker....!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Helm ready, sir.
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Nope.
I need a typewritter.
"Anguish."
I beg your pardon?
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Goodbye.
That whole...
Mmm.
Mister White is...
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
Uh huh.
Never saw the point of 'em.
I don't drink.
Oh.
Sure did.
Yes.
It used to be the Old Mill.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
No, that's true.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
Go you Huskies...
I have to tell you something...
I wasn't doing business.
Courthouse back in town.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
She wasn't in the...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
Get him on the...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Yes, yes, but...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I know, I know.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I'm only trying to...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Well.
Why?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
It burnt down.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I know you do.
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
Find the money.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
There's no witnesses...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Sherry, Sherry...
George, that is so kind of you.
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...
You think so?
Bet you did.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Mass hysteria.
What are you gonna talk about?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'll be there for you.
She is but an arriviste.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Maybe twenty.
And this is my room so get out!
Hold lunch!
MOMMY!
That doesn't bother me.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
I have lava.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Thursday's fine...
Ben where do you have to get to?
How do you know?
Oh.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
So where are you?
You say that like I don't know that.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
To make it easier for them or you?
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
You got to hell!
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Jackie?
Wowie.  How wonderful!
How the hell would you know?
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
No.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
And her...?
You're the hip and fresh.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
What?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
My Jesus…
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
He wasn't.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Oh. What happens now?
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Thanks.
Hi, Dad!
What are you doing here?
...gger.
OK.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Toby Oxman.
Great!
Yeah.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah.
How many?
Thanks.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
What for?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Times up!
Who's got matches?
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's nothing to worry about.
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
Excellent.
I say we head out.
Dissent?
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
See!  See, I told you.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
What did you say?
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
You're damned right they are.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Why can't you cancel it?
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
War.
War?
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
I said that's the point!
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Mm-hm.
Yup.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Sounds like a bummer.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Shut up! Aw...
Jesus Christ.
That sounds so depressing.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Watch out for that tree.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
What, they're looking for her?
Y- s-sure it did.
Buff...
What?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Play it! Come on!
Great.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Oh, you were in the band?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
You could do it.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
It's nice here. It's different.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
Mm.
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Erica.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Pony and I are friends.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Well, w-what happened?
Oh, shit.
I don't know.
Just go home, alright?
That, that's Indian?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Seven-twenty.
I don't know.
So you can give me more shit?
About things that are important to me.
Name one.
One!
Hey!
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Yeah.
Okay, what would you have done.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm-hm.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
What?
I, yeah.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
Of course it does.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
What are you saying?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Yeah?
That was so great!
No, I'm going.
Yep.
Where do you get your ideas?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Oh, How'd she get back?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Don't do that, man, okay?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Hello?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
You damn well better...
Maybe we can make a deal.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
I don't want it now.
Come on in, Betty,
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
No.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Yeah?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Where do you live?
I'll come early tomorrow.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Cut away from me?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Who?
The other guests?
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
I ran into some people I knew.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
For me?  Okay.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
She is upstairs.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
You made her a star?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Paramount studios.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
All right.  Camera!  Action!
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
He will be. In about five minutes.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
You're not afraid are you?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Hmmm?
Yeah.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
This is all your clothes?
I'd rather not talk about it.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
You sure?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Nope.  Never. 
Clark.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Me neither...
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
Well, aren't you excited?
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
The boss wants to see you.
I'm tryin' to.
Decaffeinated too?
Columbia.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Me? How?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
We've already met.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
Diet soda?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Don't bet on it!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Maybe I could try --
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
How could you win a crazy bet like --
Let's get you inside . . . .
Never closed my eyes.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Lois, someday --
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Lois, I really don't see why --
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
You'll have to pack quickly.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
We will bring him to his knees!
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
He ran in fear from us . . .
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Like me?
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Stuff it.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Bunkers!
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Nobody else.
We're running out of smoke.
Got it? Otis?
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Not unless you can fly.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Besides that.
Oh.
He's from another world.
Tough guy, huh?
I'm going to bed.
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
We just take it?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
What other one?
And if I don't obey?
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
Folks'll ask question.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Lara, please...
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Enjoyed it?
I guess I got carried away
How good it felt!
Twenty-four.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Do as I say. Let go!
Right on the first guess.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Maybe I should get help.
They'll soon be over.
Alison Jones.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Why are you telling me this?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
C'mon, you know that won't...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
A while.
Good night.
I have to.
Because I have to.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
You hate it.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
It's interesting.
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Was the bus on time?
Thank you, Nicole.
How old is she?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
No.
Excuse me?
No.
Why were you scared?
You could see the speedometer?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Really?
Nothing.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Will the police do anything to her?
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
Is "he" inside?
Thanks, I see him...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I guess you're right, but -
Is it news to you?
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Not just this minute, J.J....
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
No, I won't...
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Hello.
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
- that's what I mean!
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Nothing...
If you want me to -
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I didn't do anything!
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
If the stores are open -
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
My mission is to protect you.
Liquid metal.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Can I stop by my house?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Why?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Smile?
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
What?
I have to go away, John.
No shit?
No!  Don't kill him!
I know, Mom.  I know.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Unknown.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Then what?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Respect your elders and your betters!
I'm very sorry.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
With more what? More what?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Yes.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
May I ask a question?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who warned you?
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
I wish to say something.
That's an outrageous lie!
And what did he say?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Okay, so what is it?
Who's conducting?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
So. You wanted to see me.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Yes.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Sure.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Can you handle it?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Alright, the beige one.
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
It's okay.  Forget it.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Kyle...
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Okay.
Send a unit.
I just called.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Where are you going?
Why not?
That one did.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Where'd you get this?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Then, what good are you?
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
... what... ?
I saw them kill him!
Shut up!
I didn't know what else to call you.
Always.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Yeah.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Fun?
Call them.  Trust me.
I know...
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
You dodged a bullet.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
It always is.
Yes.
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Fine.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Nobody worried about your father.
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
What?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Just what I told you.
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
Yeah.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Then who called me?
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
Oh!  You scared me.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
No one will come any nearer than that.
Fifteen dollars.
It's all I could afford.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
David.
Red.  What else?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I think so.
-- but the painting!
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
First in, first out, that's me.
Too easy?
Again?
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
That's not what I heard.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
-- Your employer?
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
I don't believe it.
He alive to see this?
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He had urgent business in the north.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
No rest for the wicked.
Which kind?
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Like what.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Jennifer Wilson.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Is he here?
Who's looking for you?
Ah.
And you should tell Doris...
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
You're an enthusiast.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Birdy--
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Ah.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Huh.
No. I--tell me--
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Way out of line.
Cash?!
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
Just coffee.
Told what?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Huh?
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Uh-huh.
What the hell are you talking about?
He's the dead guy.
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
You also have an interest in the securing property?
No thanks, I--
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
He said OK. Is that what he said?
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
I appreciate that.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Behind you.
Hurry up!
What doors?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
I think I should come with you.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
You're right.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Footsteps!
What do you do?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
What's that?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
So what?
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
For what?
Oh God!  Help!
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Why would we--
Thank you.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
A window onto the human condition?
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
So when are you leaving?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
I can't tonight.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I told you I can't.
The thing that started all of this.
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Gee, that's great.
Did something happen today?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
How do you know?
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
Do something...
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Well, thank you for your help.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
You're not FBI agents.
Penetration but not perforation.
Evidence of what?
Looking for him for what?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Have you examined them?
Show you right on a map.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I know the name. Why?
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
What?
That would be my guess.
Where are you, Scully?
What happened to playing a hunch?
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
I can't really talk right now.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Been where?
I don't know.
You can't quit, Scully.
I need you on this, Scully --
No -- it's --
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
On whose orders?
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I don't know.
I have answers for you.
I want to know where Scully is.
A virus?
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Yes mother.
No.  No.
You don't know the procedure.
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Okay, okay...
No problem.
He's beautiful...
What about narcotics?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
No.  Can you get a man close?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Give her some cigarettes.
They think you did it.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Whiskey.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Yes.
Have you?
I saw him today.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
Yes.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
No.
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I don't want it.
When did you see him last?
What are you trying to say?
Pin it on a...
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
You all did.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
No, a major, were you really?
Goodness, that's awkward.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
You can help her.
But you will.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Who?
Must be some mistake.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
What else?
Not when I get interested.
Yes?
Why?
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
No.
Exactly.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I don't care about money.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
What's it mean?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Fuck that.
Don't curse in front of it.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
What'd you say?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
And? WHat did you notice?
Notice? Like what...?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
He has Israel.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Who killed Manzetti?
The arguments, anyway.
This is me.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Steve...
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
You can heat them up and eat with him.
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
I have an idea....
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Just do it.
JTS...?
Shut up...
Four. But no one this important.
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Dennis Leary.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Yes.
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
The Italian, I presume?
Hello!
Enzo Molinari.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Have the car painted.
The rules are the rules.
Noireuter.
Yes, I know.
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
What?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
... Yes.
Tea... or whiskey?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
I don't know... why?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
My wallet.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
You'll understand.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
You'll try again tomorrow?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
They're going to send detectives.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Yes... It's magic.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Oh. Okay.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
So don't show a picture.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Mazel Tov!
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Take a look.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
I don't know —-
It don't look like a leopard to me.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I drink.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
They don't say it to me.
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
You found the leopard!
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Some other time.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
You're too good to me.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Yes. Do you mind?
I got into a little crap game.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Have you got a pen?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
You’re mad...
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He’d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
...We’re turning in circles.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
No. Not us...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Do you know a friendly cop?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
What company?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Where is it?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
Anything at all?
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
At what time will you be available?
Should I come back in five minutes?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
How are you, Rhian?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
Shut up!
Is she on the phone?
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
... No.
No...
I didn’t think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I don’t wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know I’d have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Viens.
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
That’s what he said...
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
It’s a good guess...
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I -- I don't understand...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
I tried to.
I don't know...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Didn't you also carry a banner?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
We want her burned as a witch!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Guess.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
Praying.
You have nothing to regret...
Silence her!  Take her away...!
You think?
But... her army's so small now...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
Yes.
Go on to the next question.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
He's on the other side of the river.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
The bridge won't wait!
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
It's not possible...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I might ask you the same question.
I... I never lied!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Because... I have to be alone!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Oh no?  How about this one?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Yes.
He'll be here soon.
I'll be fine.
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
What?
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
That makes a change.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
I'll be back.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Spoken words?
What are they?
Everyone has to practice.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
On your piano, that is the swap.
What will I play?
Do I know any gigs?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
That's the way I want it.
Shove off, Duff.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
Forget it.
They workin' for anybody?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
You sober?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
He threatened to kill me.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
It was too noisy.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
You wanta wait for your share?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Think nothin' of it.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
2:00 A.M.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Don't think I know him.
No.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
For fifteen years.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose.....  ?
What do you mean?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Yes.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Not at all.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
Was there much blood?
You mean about that gun?
Who's your candidate?
What about Jorgensen?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
About three.
Why yes.
No.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Never mind.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
Hello, Mimi.
What do you think?
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
Why do you say that?
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
If you like 'em like that.
Who is she?
Much better, thanks.
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
Maybe it would if I took it.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Want a drink?
Did I give it to you?
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Why don't you?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Why not?
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me.
Why are you saying it?
Yes.
Bonds, sir?
I'm fired.
Oh, God.
No, please, not again.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Weird they didn't chase us.
What am I supposed to do?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Get off him!
You don't know he isn't.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
What about Jaeger?
We thought--
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
Blow me.
There might be something in there.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
They're not going to--
You can't tell anybody about this.
It's a mine, isn't it?
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Something like that.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
We're not going to do anything.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
And you; you've got it all together.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
No!
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
A headache?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
What!?
Yes!
How the hell should I know how much?
Oh, God!
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Yeah, we're down.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
You want to say some words?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Vocasity
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
I don't know.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
No one can see us now we're alone.
No!...No!...
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
I don't know.
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
And you are...?
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Who is he?
Security.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Stay here.
What? Nobody, I-
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Fuck factor ten.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
And it had diamonds in the back.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
Um-hum ...
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Um-hum!
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Monescu.
Thank you, Major. 
Now just a minute, Major--
No, Captain, I tell you--
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
But it's not enough!
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
I know that niche.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
That's what you need!
Peaches and cream.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
As you like. 
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
That sounds sensible. 
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Um-hum ...
Then a little nap--
Goodbye.
Talk? About me--about us?
You would?
Yes, I would!
I know all your tricks.
Mariette!
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Jacques!
Right!
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
But you're the more intelligent one.
Then why did you do it?
But you saw it here.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Lewis...
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
I felt like black.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Sure. Count me in.
Good. Settled then.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
No you won't.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
Could I speak to you in private?
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Au contraire, mon cher.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Now it's worse.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
It's so cold.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
I'm so cold.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
I can explain--
Oh--a hundred times--
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Want to take it back?
I could stand some more--
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Don't rub it in.
At seven-thirty?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I'll be there--Good-by.
But--
You can live that down, can't you?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Are you screwy?
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Thank you, sir. 
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Much better--thank you--
Think again--
I wouldn't be surprised--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
I'll go with you.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Sure.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
So what?
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Like it?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Very--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Get that out of your trunk.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
Why don't you leave me alone?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Maybe even my destiny.
Well I'm not so go home.
Yeah, you look it.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Ignore her?
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
Never got to wear one of those.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Good God, you're really-
Colorado's closer
Fun though, wasn't it?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Wyatt...
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
What're you talkin' about?
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Jack...
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
So to speak.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I wonder if it runs in the family.
And still not a thing to watch.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Not all of us, 007.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
I see...
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Have we met?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I'll keep that in mind.
Let's not make it a habit.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
And number two?
Now.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Of course.
Stop it!
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Who's Wade?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Yes.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I'm busy.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
Not anymore, not in the city.
You're always taking his side.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You must have been really sick.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
Good afternoon to you.
Now who are we talking about?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Those boys never did have good luck.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Yeah!
Right here in the van.
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
Woody!  Buzz!
Here!  In the car!
Let's let Molly open one.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Sorry.
Shhh!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Yeah, right.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Woody!  The rocket!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Murderer!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
You are a liar!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
I was close to being scared that time.
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
What?!
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I've got a present for you...
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
All the time.
It's all right, Finn.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
I can't find Manolo.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
What is he being charged with?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Yeah.
I get A's.  All A's.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
What is this, like freebase?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Nope.
She ain't in on it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
I don't think you're going to do that.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
I have money --
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Did you bring the cards?
I'd fucking kill you.
Great.
Shut up.
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
Well, it isn't.
It's Iggy Pop.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
Fuck, OK.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
It's no problem.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Another dab?
Running time?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Yeah.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
Such as?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Rescued at last.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Put it on the screen.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
I've always known... I'll die alone.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
Fascinating.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Be one with the horse.
Captain, what have I done -
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Is what possible?
Hmmm?
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?





  
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Okay, okay...
Of what?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I'm sorry -
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
It can be arranged...
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Where did you hear that name?
You're alive!
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Yes.
How about you?
Probably.
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
But-what if I can't...?
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Do it!
As long as it gets us out of here
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Fine.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Why?
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
In her dreams.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
What're you talking about?  We have that.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Here they come.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
I agree.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Yeah, it was wild.
Good thinking, honey.
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
He needed my help.
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I can do it!
Sure, hon.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
Go ahead.
I understand.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
And you chased one?
We're going to Paris?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Knock wood.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Where are you from.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
You mean she got a bad batch?
You didn't do nothing.
Who?
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
What?
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
I'm a married man.
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
I know.
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Two guys.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
How 'bout me what?
Want an animal cracker?
Look, Dick, I don't -
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Me too, Boris.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
They didn't tell me.
Sure.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Step inside.
Not a tiny little vial -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Do you know where we can find him?
I didn't mean -
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
You're still a little... disoriented.
Meaning...???
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I have to go.
A jail?  Prison?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
No, 1995 is the past.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
James, why don't we...?
Jeffrey Mason?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
The gun! ... I lost it
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
Not, "what", babe!  When!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Christ!
Nothing.
Where to?
How much.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Don't look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
Taking a little trip?
I . . .
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
You sure you can manage?
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Least you can leave.
Those are white words, not ours.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You just walk away.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Whatever it takes.
I can't.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I wanted to talk.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
What was I supposed to do?
We're going all the way.  Together.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He was going to take the money.
Just drive.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
It's . . . it's locked.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Husband . . .?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You've got to be--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I had a problem getting my car back.
About what you said this morning.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
SHUT UP!
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Will you shut up!
You expect me to believe that?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Wouldn't know anything about it.
I don't understand what the--
I think you might just want to do as I say.
You want something?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Stand up.
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You've got to be--
That's a solid name.
Live there?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
No!
It's the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
What?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
No charge.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No! No police.
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
No trouble at all, really.
You're not from around here, are you?
You've been around.
Lift me down.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
I'm not coming back.
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
"Arkady"
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Out of here.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
How much?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yes.
Four.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I'll keep it in my office room.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Seventy-five percent.
In college. A car accident.
You assumed wrong.
We've already begun.
One last question.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
What's he look like?
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Get mom.
There's no more left?
How long have you been married?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Maybe he ain't so tough.
Nope.
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
They really got all that money, them whores?
I could run off them whores.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... Duke.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Yeah, I guess so.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Oh.
Lookin' at?
He got the boy's horse.
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
After a ways.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yeah.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
Eleven.
This Kid, what's he like?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Nothin's bent.
You gonna share your half with him?
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Yeah?
Hell, yeah.
I don't get it.
There's more.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
They ruined me tonight.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Umm ...
This whole thing was a shakedown.
They fucking know everything.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
If you'll just let me -
Tough break.
Maybe more.
We'll make it.
You're lying.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
What'the fuck is that?
Which is shit.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
I just want to hear your story.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
He didn't have my lawyer.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
Kobayashi.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Why didn't you say anything?
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
Edie.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
Why lie about everything else, then?
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Immunity.
What did he find?
Four cases in three years ...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes.
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
We went to Code Blue...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
I know of him.
How old are you?
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
No.
I...yes.
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
... that's all right.
I am seventy-four years old.
The Doctors were not negligent.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.  I wrote it.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Why?
Her doctors killed her.
The most respected ...
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
I was held up.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm sure you would.
That's perfectly all right.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Listen to me, fella...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Overruled...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
Pardon?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe what?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
That's what I am.
I...do you want me to leave?
You, you don't under...
It's over!
I have to talk to you.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
Don't touch anything.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
...one of the other nurses?
The 'History'...?
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
She told me.
In New York?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes...
Yes.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Should I?
I married into it.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No, I'm all right.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
What happened?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Let me come in.
But you haven't lived here long.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Because I remind you of her?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Don't go.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Yes. Yes, I do.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
That's what I had in mind.
No, Ernie's is fine.
How does it work?
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
At...
Oh... wandering about.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
Oh! Yes! Here!
Wander about.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
I don't like them.
And no birds sing.
Where?
Have you been here before?
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What?!
Where?
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Yes.
How long has she had the room?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Uh-huh!
Normal.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
You haven't told me everything.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
Well...
First of all...
What?
Alright. Let's do it.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
Later.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
There's more.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
Lois please.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
No.
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
You need help.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
They need leadership.
Not really, no.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
You said nobody would miss her.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
I do.
Sent it.
I think I forgot the tent.
Why?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Don't you dare.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Kiss me...?
I'll call them from the road.
Well you should.
How late?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
What kind of stupid question is that?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
Greenpeace.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
The stone age.
Take your time. I wish I had.
Yes, yes.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
You'll think you're still at the convent.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Whatever you like.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Fifteen yards.
He was asking for it.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
No.
Why?
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
What's he called?
Canelo!
A black bull came.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Me? What did I do?
But only you will know he's not human.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
What did you find out?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
Should I have?
My God...
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
It wasn't a lie.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
I'm still working on it.
I've been in prison, remember?
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
Thanks.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?

Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.

Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.

I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.

Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
So what firm you with, pal?
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Allright. Wait here...
You're learning, sport...
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Old values. Buy.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
I can't...and I won't.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
So why are you dating Jonathan?
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
No.  But once I heard...
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
You're joking.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Do you?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
The wives.
I have to go.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Is everything alright?
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Yeah.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
You are?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
You got it.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
All of us.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I guess not.
Norman Spencer.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Nice.  Almost done.
It's okay if you're not.
I know.
Did she say that?
To make sure she's all right.
Mmnph.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Yep.
Huh.
Dressed?
...like it never even happened...
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
I will NOT.
Not personally.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
Yes.  The ghost.
It's Madison Fra--
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Your wife...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Get out of my way.
She can't be here without me.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
Two what...?
Michael, Rowan should -
Every day  twice.
He made that quite clear, yes.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
To love, you must be able to feel.
Only you...
I know.    you are my son -
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
I'm serious.  You don't -
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
- we made a fire.
Stop it!
On which planet...?
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I think I will pass...
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
You've killed but you're not a killer
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Why not? Please - it would help me
No thanks - 
He doesn't need to...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
So that's a maybe?
Yeah? You like?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
That was code for "I like you."
I mean, what do you think?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I'm getting so good at this.
Well, why should I?
Yeah.
Whatever helps you cope.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
It's okay. You need me?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
The one with the horses.
Hi ho, Silver.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Everything.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Me-ow.
Your article sucked.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I mean my father.
Eventually you'll let go.
Let's do it.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
But absolutely true.
You're quick. I like that.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
You promise you'll finish school?
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
I'm warning you.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Tipping?
What kind of ideas?
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
I'm just a messenger.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
And where might that be?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Maybe she used another name.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
We don't know that, Ray...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
You didn't cuff her?
I wanna go home now.
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Nothing.
I'm not on your property!
You notice my new jumper?
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
I won't.
Stick?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Okay.  I love you too.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I just want my life back...
That's cop bullshit.
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
The one you bought at school.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Funny.  So am I.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Try what?
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
And people are actually fooled by that?
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
What is this?  A whole new train?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
You bring the best out in a man.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
On my way to Denver...
I deal with some tough customers.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
We'll explain on the way.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
In an hour they're gone!
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
I don't know.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Absolutely!
Of course!  I promise!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Elora Danan!
That's all I ever wanted!
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Why?
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Queen Cherlindrea?
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Why not?
They're Amish.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
I thought I was the English.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Yes, sir.
Who'd you see?
...I want to say a thing.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
It's not a joke.
We do not go into your courts.
They kid a lot.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I know.
That's God's way!
He's got my number.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
No...
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
I don't think she knows.
No --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
To see?
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
I don't believe you!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
No, they won't - honestly.
Me?
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Look -- it ticks!
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Dorothy next!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Th.D.?
With this?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Elektra would control it all.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
The inside man?
Which is neutral, no doubt.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Yes.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Not interested.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Of course...
Where it can do the most damage.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
I could stay and go.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Jon -- what??
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Laurie --
Memory lane.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Yes you are.
. . . What??
Where did he go?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I'm sorry about Blake.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
He gets to be the hero.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Viktor! Stay the course.
That one I'm real familiar with.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
... until he found tungsten.
It's too far.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What if I like the pain?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Is it enough?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Victor Frankenstein.
Now wait a minute!
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMmmm.
I promise.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
I suppose you're right.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
What wockers?
What are you doing here?
If you like -- just hurry!
Thank you, Master.
Throw the third switch!
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
But you did -- I just heard it.
It wasn't me.
... I'm glad that's...
Yes, Master!
That's what we're paid for.
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
Ja, ja.
How nice.
Inga, wake up!
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Raise the platform, hurry!
What do you think we should do?
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I know Frederick.
But, after all, you have yours.
Yes, I know.
Four
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
